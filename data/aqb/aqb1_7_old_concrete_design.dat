TXE
TXE The maximum compressive strain is automatically taken from the
TXE strain stress law of the concrete, while the tensional strain
TXE has to be specified explicitly.
TXE As their are different approaches to get a solution by manual design
TXE the given references will not always provide optimal solutions.
TXE All old results providing more compressive reinforcement than
TXE tension reinforcements are neither allowed today nor will AQB
TXE evaluate such results.
