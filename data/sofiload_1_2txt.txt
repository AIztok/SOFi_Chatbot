1 General
SOFiLOAD generates loading for all SOFiSTiK-Modules.
Loads are organized in load cases, which are members of a unique action. Load cases are
addressedviaanumber,whiletheactionisdesignatedbyupto4characters,48combinations
have been reserved for designated types of actions.
Thecombinationoftheloadcaseswithintheactionsmaybedoneinaverygeneralway,there
are however three predefined combination methods: permanent, optional, exclusive.
The final combination of the actions is then done within MAXIMA or AQB via combination
coefficients (ψ) and safety factors (γ), which may vary in there value from load case to load
case, but will be always applied with the same kind of factor.
The loads can be defined independently of a FEM-mesh. SOFiLOAD will handle the transition
fromthegeometricmodeltotheanalysismodelbyconvertinggeneralloadingpatternstomore
specific nodal or elemental loads. The user may influence the conversion process if needed.
The loads are either already in the database or may be defined via SOFiLOAD. If the element
mesh is changed, SOFiLOAD has to repeat the elemental assignment. Beside that you may
specify nodal or elemental loads directly as known from other finite element systems. Those
loads will be deleted however if the element mesh is changed or explicit redefinition of a load
case takes place.
Record names and items have been change compared to former definitions in SOFiSTiK to
become more simple and unified. Thus it is not possible in general to copy old CADINP-data,
but the export-function may be helpful in many cases. All input load values will be converted
according to the units defined in SOFiSTiK. DIM.
Therearealsopossibilitiestogenerateloadsfromresultsinthedatabase. Theseareespecially
support forces converted to loads, imperfections, creep deformations or prestressing effects.
As an special extension we have provided or intended load generators to deal with the rather
complex loading of load trains on bridges, earth quake, wind and snow on the structure with
very extended features. These options are not part of the basic program version however.
This manual starts with the simple nodal and elemental loads, will then cover the geometric
load definitions and finally come to the more complex load generators.

2 Theoretical Principles
2.1 Equivalent Nodal Loads
The Finite Element system is a discrete system and is therefore only enabled to treat with
equivalentnodalloadcontributions,notwithrealpointloadsormoments. Thedifferenceofthe
two meanings can be seen in Figure 2.1.
Figure2.1: Equivalentnodalloadsformeshrefinement
Whenthemeshdensityisincreased,youwillhavedifferentloadpatternsforadistributedload,
butthesameforapointload. Thisindicatesalsothatagivenmeshhasadistinctresolutionfor
loaddistributions. Thecoarsermeshcannotdistinguishbetweentwopointloads,adistributed
load or a point load between the nodes.
On the other side this states that a load may be specified as a single nodal load only if the
sizeofloadislessthantheelementmeshsize. Ifyourefinethemeshnearthatloadpointyou
willgethigherandhigherstressesorforces,asthefiniteelementswillapproximateyouinfinite
solution better and better. So you choose either a mesh size not smaller than the minimum
load distribution area (thickness for plates for example) or you have to specify the loads as
distributed loads.
From that we conlude further, that the generated nodal loads by SOFiLOAD may be only as
accurate as the given Finite Element mesh.
For beam loading we have the special case, that loading is also defined within the element
having an effect on all internal forces. But we have to distinguish between a standard FE-
Beam-Element having only cubic displacement functions and a more generalized Beam Ele-
ment according to the Transfer-Method. The first will require a finer mesh to model complex
loading accurately, the latter may have restrictions on the modelling of the stiffness. (Piece-

wise constant in STAR2 e.g).
2.2 Prestressing Loads
For springs, cables and trusses you may specify in SOFiMSHA a constant value of prestress,
acting in any load case. For cables and trusses you may also define a load case dependant
prestress. Any type of prestress will introduce like a thermal expansion strains acting on the
element.
Cablesandtrusseswillbeprestressesbysomeexternalinfluence. Forfixedendsthesestrains
will introduce the prestress, for flexible supports you will get deformations diminishing your
given prestress. If you want to achieve a given value of prestress you have to define external
loading or use an element with low stiffness and the given prestress.
For beams, by contrast, prestress is defined as an equilibrium state of stress (prestressed
concreteviatendons). Thuswehaveanadditionalcomponenttoconsider. Sincetheprestress
is imposed on the element itself, the resulting forces on freely deformable beams are the input
prestressforcesthemselves. Ifthedeformationisconstrainthowever,constrainingforcesarise.
In the limiting case, e.g. if a beam is not allowed to deform at all the resultant force is zero,
because the forces imposed by the prestress are beared by the support instead of the beam.
For beams you may specify a statically determinate part of the prestress by the tendon force
and its eccentricity and inclination. The distribution along the axis is linear for the stress, but
cubically for the eccentricity. The effect of the prestress has to aspects. First we have the
additional forces within a section, second we have deformations, introducing new forces if
constraints exist.

3 Input Description
3.1 Input language
The input occurs in a free format with the CADINP input language (see the general manual
SOFiSTiK: ”FEA / STRUCTURAL Installation and Basics”).
Input is defined within blocks of CADINP-Input language, separated by the record name END.
Within each block, values to CTRL and ECHO will be active for the total block, while all other
values cover only the current load case.
There are the following possibilities:
• Only definition of LC with a number
Will print all loads of that load case.
• Definition of LC with parameters but without any loading
Will change those parameters and redistribute all global loading to a the current mesh.
• Input of LC with loads
The load case is redefined, deleting all old data.
Three categories of units are distinguished:
mm Fixed unit. Input is always required in the specified unit.
[mm] Explicit unit. Input defaults to the specified unit. Alternatively, an explicit as-
signment of a related unit is possible (eg. 2.5[m] ).
[mm] Implicit unit. Implicit units are categorised semantically and denoted by a cor-

Without specification all elements will be used. If defining values only the selected groups will
be used for the elemental loads of the following load cases. Group selections will be ignored,
if a free defined loading is applied based on structural elements (SLN, SAR, LAR as well as
AUTO on these) Thus this selection will be needed only for those cases where the geometric
selection is not sufficient.
The selection of groups may be different for different load cases. For very complex load pat-
terns you may generate the loading within several load cases and combine them then via the
command COPY to a single load case.
The value CW defines a global factor to the wind pressure coefficients. The pressure coeffi-
cients are defined for plane elements via the record name QUAD, for beam elements they are
defined with the sections. Reduction factors ψ are f.e. defined for chimneys as a function of
the total height.
The value CFR defines the frictional coefficients cfr according Table 10.13.1. of EC 1 part 2-4:

different wind loading areas and roughness values.

The entries within one row with preceding Z for additional loading and S for special loading
may be treated in AQB as belonging to the same action.
For the seiesmic action there is in EN 1998 an importance factor γ  depending on the impor-
tance class to be selected by the user explicitly:
Class factor Description
I 1.4 Buildings whose integrity during earthquakes is of vital importance for civil
protection, e.g. hospitals, fire stations, power plants, etc.
II 1.2 Buildings whose seismic resistance is of importance in view of the conse-
quences associated with a collapse, e.g. schools, assembly halls, cultural
institutions etc.
III 1.0 Ordinary buildings, not belonging to the other categories
IV 0.8 Buildings of minor importance for public safety, e.g. agricultural buildings,
etc.
In principal every action may be subdivided by categories. For some action types (Q, L or
S) the values from EN 1990 (resp. DIN 1055-100, Table A2 or other deviations) are already
available as follows:

A definition of ACT will reinitialize the action with the defaults defined in the INI-file depending
on the category of the design code. Values GAMU to PS1S replace the predefined values.
The user should check the defaults in all cases. Deviations of the PSI-values for wind and
temperature especially for bridges or other non buildings are to be expected as all values are
"boxed values" depending on individual or country dependant settings. For example you will
findinOENORMB4750categorieswithtrucksbetween30and60kNwithvaluesaugmented

in an own action L (with categories L_F, L_G and L_H) or whether these categories should be
a part of the action Q in addition to the payloads for buildings (categories Q_A till Q_H).
If the category of the design code or the design code is changed in AQUA, all actions should
be redefined. ACT INIT deletes all defined actions and superposition rules if specified in
SOFiLOAD.
WiththespecificationofACTallsubsequentloadcasesinSOFILOADwillthenhavethisaction
type as default.
The item PART defines, to which action of the selected superposition equation the input ac-
tion belongs. The actions in the superposition equations are distinguished according to their
temporal variances:
• permanent actions: PART G e.g dead load
PART P prestress
• variable actions PART Q
PART Q_1 load group 1
PART Q_2 load group 2
...
PART Q_99 load group 99
• accidental actions PART A
• seismic action PART E
ThustheitemPARTallowsthecorrectclassificationofuser-definedactions,butalsoofspecial
cases as for example PART G SUP ALEX (always but exclusive, it means, that only one load
case is always used). Exclusively the item SUP controls, how the load cases which are a part
of the actions are used for the superposition (always, conditional, mutually exclusive).
Meant for example PART P, that the input action is used in the equation part Pk for superposi-
tionsforultimateandserviceabilitylimitstate(EC,DIN,DIN-FB,seemanualMAXIMA,chapter
2).
The item PART depends on TYPE for preset actions. For example PART G is the default for
theactionsG,G_1andG_2,PARTPfortheactionsPandC,PARTQfortheactionsQandL,
PART A for the action A and PART E for the action E.
The item PART has to be input for user-defined actions. Otherwise the user-defined actions
get PART Q (default).
Hint
All categories of an action must have the same definition of PART. E.g. categories Q_A
and Q_B of the variable action Q get PART Q. Only the load groups of a variable action
PART Q_1 till Q_99 can be different.

will be taken from the INI-File, but for free defined types of actions it is EXCL in general, if the
type of the action has a leading Q it will become COND and for a leading G it will be PERM.
In MAXIMA one may overwrite this for any particular load case of an action or recombine
load cases (e.g. 0.7*LC_101(Ex)+0.5*LC_102(Ey)). Due to historic reasons there are special
literals at record LC in MAXIMA in addition to the literals of SUP:

F additional load case to be combined
Using SUP PERM the same partial safety factor is used for all load cases of a permanent
action (e.g. ACT G). In this case the sum of the values of the single load cases is decisive,
whether the unfavourable (GAMU) or the favourable (GAMF) partial safety factor is applied. In
the contrast to that the partial safety factors are considered load-case-wisely, if SUP PERC is
defined. Here one load case of the permanent action can get GAMU and another GAMF.
SUP EXEX excludes only categories against each other within an action (no exclusion
of different actions). If for example the categories X_1 and X_2 of the action X are defined
with SUP EXEX, then only the most unfavourable load case is used either from X_1 or from
X_2andalsoonly,ifithasanunfavourablecontribution. Inthecontrasttothatanunfavourable
load case from X_1 and an unfavourable load case from X_2 are used for the input of SUP
EXCL.
SUP ALEX defines a permanent alternative group (MAXIMA record LC TYPE AG1). Only
the load cases of an action or all load cases of the categories of an action are used for the
formationofapermanentalternativegroup. Hereonlyaloadcaseisconsideredforthesuper-
position, also if it has a favourable contribution. Load cases of different actions do not exclude
themselves mutually. If SUP ALEX is input for some actions, a load case is considered per
action.
In program MAXIMA it is additionally possible to assign load cases of an action or category to
severalpermanentalternativegroups. TheinputisdoneinprogramMAXIMAwithLC... TYPE

The total mechanism of the defaults for the action types is governed by the following rules:
• ByselectingadesigncodewithinAQUAalldefinitionsgivenintheassociatedINI-Fileinthe
3-12 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|SOFiLOAD
[action] -section will become available. If no such file is available, defaults in the program
are available for all EC and newer DIN (since year 2000). For all other cases there are
exactly two predefined actions G and Q without any coefficients or factors.
• When addressing an action, a copy of this definition is created in the database which has
then the possibility of deviating factors if explicitly defined with this record or via the SOFi-
PLUS menus.
• When creating a load case, the factors are copied from the action definition to the load
case. However, those factors may be modified for any individual load case.
• For special design purposes the factors may be changed temporarily when using the load
cases in AQB.
Variable action - load groups:
TheloadgroupsPARTQ_1tillQ_99canbeusedforabetterformationofcombinationwithout
intermediate superpositions in MAXIMA e.g. for the load models of the bridge design (EN
1990/A1). If different load groups are defined for categories with corresponding inputs for the
item SUP, then the intermediate superpositions and the following superpositions are done in
one MAXIMA run.

are mutually exclusive about the input SUP EXEX.
With one of the MAXIMA combinations then the superposition is done as follows: First of all
MAXIMA searches which load cases of the load group 1 are decisive (possible one ore two or
noloadcase=firstintermediatesuperposition).Thenthedecisiveloadcaseoftheloadgroups
2 and 3 is determined (possible one or no load case = second intermediate superposition). In
the last step the final superposition is done. Either the decisive load cases of the load group 1
or the decisive load case of the goups 2 and 3 are here the final result.
It should be noted here that load groups are mutually exclusive. If, for example, the superpo-
sition of the load cases for two load load groups are specified with SUP COND - conditionally,
only the load cases of the decisive load group are taken into account.
Example:
PROG SOFILOAD
HEAD
ACT XY_1 gamu 1.4 0.0 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.6 PART Q_1 SUP cond
ACT XY_2 gamu 1.3 0.0 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.5 PART Q_2 SUP cond
The load cases of category XY_1 belong to load group 1 and those of category XY_2 belong
to load group 2. Thus, either the load cases of XY_1 or of XY_2 are taken into account in the
superposition depending on which brings the more unfavorable result.

The factor of the load case has (despite the wind load generator) no specific influence in
SOFiLOAD and may be changed later at any time. Loads will be multiplied by this factor only
when used in the analysis itself. The factor FACT affects all forces and moment loadings,
however, not temperature, strain and prestressing loadings! It does also not affect dead load
factors FACD, DLX, DLY or DLZ.
The components of the dead weight will be in the positive direction of the requested global
axis. You have to enter the correct sign for DLX to DLZ. If you specify only FACD, SOFiLOAD
will apply the dead load in the direction defined as the gravity direction. A definition will delete
all loads of this load case automatically.
As type of the load case on may specify the name of an action. Only predefined or explicitly

Values GAMU to PS1S belong to the action TYPE in general. However they may have indi-

current values from the action will be taken as default for the individual load case for Version
23. Starting with version 2010 however only the explicitly defined values will be kept, all other
values will adopt to those of the action itself if the action is changed.
ValuesCRI1toCRI3areverygeneralparametersoftheloadcase. Theymaybeusedfreelyfor
postprocessing via DBVIEW. You may specify them in advance or set them after the analysis
by reading some results from the database. (e.g. a system dimension, a strength reduction
etc.) TALPA uses CRI1 for the safety factor of the material needed by analysis according to
Fellenius.
A load case imperfection will be defined with TYPE IMP. The load cases of this type allow to
use imperfection loads for the definition of load case combinations for the analysis according
to second order theory. These load cases can not be used for a linear analysis of single load
caseswithASE,STAR2andalsonotforasuperpositíonofthelinearloadcaseswithMAXIMA.
Defining TYPE EINF a load case will be declared as influence line. You have to specify at
least one load to select the value, the influence line is intended for. You need a separate load

Local load directions require nodes with a local coordinate system (SOFiMSHC). Only nodes
which are input as structural points (SPT points) with a local coordinate system in SOFiMSHC
can be used here. If no such system is found, the global coordinate directions will be used
instead.
For special cases you may multiply the load values with the radius (e.g. centrifugal forces,
internal pressures etc) or with the square of the radius. The radius is the distance of the node
to the global axis which has been selected as gravity direction.
Inthecaseofaxialsymmetryloadvaluesareinterpretedascircumferencerelated,e.g. aradial
load of 2 kN/m must be provided as PYY ±2.0. The program then automatically accounts for
the radial position of the load application point.
If a degree of freedom which has a kinematic constraint gets a nodal displacement, the con-
straint will be deactivated. There is no way to invert that support condition. That’s why there
are no local displacements available. They have to to be modelled with stiff spring elements if
desired.

LoadingonBeamswillbedefinedeitherviatrapezoidalloadsviaBEAMorasPointloadsvia
BEPL or as general variant loading via multiple BEPL function values.
Loadingonbeamswillbedefinedindependentfromanelementalsubdivisioncoveringmultiple
elements. You may specify always a range of element numbers establishing a total beam.
The extensions of the loading will be referenced always to the total set of selected beam el-
ements. The position within the section is always based on the beam axis. I.e. for a centric
beam this will be the gravity axis, for an eccentric beam it will be the reference axis which is
in the origin of the cross section coordinate system. The default however is always "gravity
center". The input reference system may be changed for every single beam loading.
The beams will be appended despite their position in space in the sequence of their element
numbers from start node to end node. Numbers may be missing within the sequence. If the
coordinates of two successive beams do not match a message will be issued if the value of
INC is defined explicitly.

The Literal CONT for item TYPE will activate defaults from the last record:

A (new) = A+L (old)
This simplifies the definition of trapezoidal combined loads
BEAM 101 PZ PE 100 L 2
= CONT PE 120 L 5
= CONT PE 0
This input defines a load ascending from 0 to 100 within the length of 2, then up to 120 within
the length five and descending than to the end.
The eccentricities of the load are defined in the local beam coordinate system with reference
to the connecting line between the nodes. This is the so called reference axis. If not defined
explicitly,thiswillbethecenterlineofgravity. LoadsoftypePwillcreatemomentsifeccentric-
itiesarepresent. Fornonlinearanalysistherewillbeadditionalgeometricstiffnessandforces.
There is a difference between loads acting on the upper or lower side of a section.
General temperature distributions over the cross-sectional height (temperature profile for fire
design) may be specified with several load inputs, each describing a temperature level with a
location ZA,ZE. These general temperature profiles can be processed by the 2D FiberBeam
(TALPA). Regarding the interpretation of the ordinates ZA and ZE, three options are distin-
guished:
• If REFT -Z is defined, the provided ordinates refer to the uppermost fibre of the section; all
ZA,ZE must be ≥0.
• With REFT +Z, the provided ordinates refer to the lowermost fibre; all ZA,ZE must be ≤0.
• In all other cases, the ordinates ZA,ZE are interpreted as relative measures and will be
scaled to the actual cross-sectional dimension.
PositivevaluesofDTYandDTZmeanthatthetemperatureraisesinthepositivedirectionofthe
corresponding y resp. z axis. Example: For a beam cross section the temperature decreases,
if 40 ◦C are available at the side -y and 10 ◦C at the side +y. Thus the input reads DTY -30
[◦C]. This load type is only applicable for sections having a distinct extension or geometry.
An input of a temperature profile along the sectional local z-axis followed by the EVAL TEQV will
resultinacomputationoftheequivalentlineartemperaturedistributions. Formoredetails,see
EVAL and Subsection 3.22.1.
The prestressing loadings PNX, PMY and PMZ are the result of a special imposed strain or
curvature. If theelementisfixed, theresulting forces andmomentswillbeidentical tothoseof
the loading. However, if the element may deform the prestress is then reduced. The opposite
behaviour is given for the tendon prestress definable with BEPL, an eigen stress state which
needs deformability to become active. For very special cases this type of prestressing may be
also defined with load type PNXI for a whole beam in record BEAM.

information of these records (FROM TO INC) will not be evaluated.

Theloadingwillbeonlyappliedwithinthedefinedabscissae,youneedatleasttwodatapoints
therefore. If you specify only one single value, additional values will be supplied with 0.0 for
imperfections at the beginning and the end. Thus only one value at one of the ends will create
a linearly varying distribution, while one in the middle will generate a quadratic parabola. All
other load types will become constant along the total beam sequence.
For the load type PNX the cubically interpolated eccentricities Ey and EZ will generate mo-

All elements within the given range of numbers will be loaded. The range may be larger than
the existing numbers but must contain at least one element. Instead of a number FROM the
literal GRP and the group number at TO can be specified to select all elements of a group. If
the printout of the selected elements is intended instead of the group the value INC has to be
specified explicitly as 1.
With DPX to DPZ the user specifies global varying loads (like earth or water pressure), P is
then the value at (X,Y,Z), while DPX to DPZ describe the increment in the global coordinate
directions. The Unit will be converted by the load and the geometry unit (1001).
With NTYP the user may define additional data for the loading like a reference number of
prestress or special actions for wind or snow loading.
LoadingsoftypePXP,PYPandPZPwilluseNTYPasamaximum"roofinclination"indegree.
With such a definition, only elements will be loaded, if the inclination of the normal of the area
3-34 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|SOFiLOAD
against the load is smaller than this value. The sign of NTYP selects the allowed orientation
of the normal of the area relative to the load direction. Thus TYPE PZP NTYP 60 will act only
on elements with a positive component of the normal in global Z-direction and not inclined by
more than 60 degrees to the XY-plane.
Someloads,e.g. Tforafiredesignmaybespecifiedwithafunctiondescribingthevaluealong
the local z-axis. Up to 16 values may be defined as a pair of a thickness and a factor. Their
are three cases to be distinguished: If all ordinates are positive, they are referred absolutely
to the uppermost fibre of the QUAD-element, if they are all negative they are referred to the
lowermost fibre. In all othe cases the reference is the mid surface of the QUAD element. If the
real thickness of the QUAD element does not match the load definition, the definition will be
scaled with a warning for the third case.

The loading types of prestress will generate a stress state and the corresponding strains and
curvatures to calculate the constraining contributions.
Load type PRE (Prestress from TENDON) will generate the loading due to tendon with pre-
stress stage NTYP within the selected QUAD-elements. The load value P should be 1.0, but

the database will not be changed by this factor. In ASE the user has to select the appropriate
construction stage number CS in record GRP. The Input
GRP ... CS 0 ; QUAD 1 9999 1 TYP PRE 1.0 NTYP 1
will generate the prestress loading of the first stage on the net section. The calculated defor-
mations will not create additional stresses in the tendons.
For the influence areas the loading will generate a dirac-delta strain within the centre of the
elements. Load value will be 1.0 in general. The deformation of the mesh is the required
influence area. However, directly in the point of interest the FE- approach will smooth out the
singularity of the theoretical influence area.

COPY will transfer loading from other load cases to the current load case. All types of loading
definitionsincludinggeneratedloadsbyotherprogramswillbecopied. Theselfweightcreated
by the factors DLX-DLZ of record LC will be copied only if not yet defined in this load case
directly or with another COPY command within this load case.
For larger systems it might be considerably faster to copy only the nodal and elemental loads.
With a selection of NODE, BEAM, TRUS, CABL. QUAD or BRIC generated loads will be also
copied. If the COPY should be restricted to user defined loads, a ” : E” must be added to the
type.
Instead of ALL the selection of INTE will copy the generated nodal analysis loads. Elemental
loading especially temperature or prestress loading may not be treated with that method. The
generated nodal loads from self weight will be copied only with TYPE INTE. But this requires
ASE to have analyzed this load case.
Without specification of a project name, the support forces will be read from the current
database, otherwise the loads will be taken from that database.
All load cases of an action are copied with the input of the action name for load case number
NO.
Load functions may not be copied, as every load case must have a unique load function.
The load case NO may be created within a previous or the same input block. All loads may be
copied with a factor. As the global load factor of LC is not applied to the loads in the database
itself, the old global load factor remains out of scope.

When copying loads, it will be remembered the source of the loadings, thus a restart (LC nn
REST) will repeat the copy process and use the current load definitions. With CTRL COPY
256 this will be supressed, the loads are then taken as currently defined and will be treated as
explictly defined loadings.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-43SOFiLOAD|InputDescription
3.14.1 Support forces
With the load type PSUP the program will convert nodal reaction forces and with SUPP also
moments at nodes to free POIN loads. The reference type will be AUTO unless otherwise
selected with CTRL COPY, i.e. the loads will be applied within the WIDE selection in any
suitableway. Theloadswillbeprojectinginthegravitydirection. AnegativevalueofWIDEwill
switch to a projection N, requiring a load definition at the true location.
With DX, DY or DZ the user can select a special coordinate value to select nodes. If the value
LEV is defined, only nodes with that ordinate in gravity direction will be treated. DX, DY and
DZ are then shifts allowing to move loads from one storey precisely to another probably lower
level.
3.14.2 Load trains
If the load case to be copied contains a load train definition TRAI, NREF must be an identifier
of a reference axis, with the specification of one of the possible lanes with number 0 to 9
appended as additional decimal digit. DX is the station value along the axis.
Loads of a loadtrain will be clipped at the edges of the traffic lane. This may be used together
with YEX to apply wide special trains across several lanes. Some loadings (eg. LM1 together
with a LM3) will not be influenced by YEX.
Loadtrains with variable distances or acting as a convoy those distances may be specified
explicitly with the items XCON (see TRAIN) , XV1 to XV 15. It is also possible to set the load
train at a position saved from ELLA with Option ECHO LPOS. To achieve this it is necessary
to specify the TYPE ELLA, to specify with NO the number of the result load cases created by
ELLA and to enter REF, CASE, NRE / XABS to address the correct selection. The respective
result will be deducted from the result load case number automatically.
It has to be pointed out however, that SOFILOAD is not able to model all fancy details of load-
ingsasimplementedinELLA.ELLAtransfersthefavourableandunfavourableareasbasedon
the vertical loading and the position of the loading. SOFILOAD can not cope with variable ex-
centricities and special combination effects. ELLA may decide about favourable/unfavourable
elementary based on all load components, while SOFILOAD has to select based on the verti-
cal loading only. This includes the special effect that a point or tandem load in ELLA may be
treated at the same position to be before or behind a point at the same time.
Spans will be defined with placements along the axis, if those do not exist or INC LANE is
specified the segments defined with LANE will be taken instead. The values FROM to TO
select the spans of the lane with a loading pattern controlled by a DELT input (the dotted line
indicates the load train position specified):

the selected DX point. If INC is zero, only the selected range is loaded. If MAX is defined for
INC also every second span outside the range is loaded. MIN will always reverse the selected
pattern. A really correct evaluation for complicated loading should be performed via influence
lines and module ELLA.
Loads will be copied as default with a factor of one, but one may specify for FACT one of
the literals DESI, RARE, FREQ, NONF, PERM to select the combination coefficients of the
load case to be multiplied with. As an alternate or additional mean one may select with TYPE
combinations for load groups according to the EC1 or DIN Fachbericht. While without entry all
loads are taken, the possible values are:
GR0 Single vertical loads only

3.14.3 Wind and Wave loads
Loading on areas with wind according to EN 1991 requires a lot of calculation steps, as the
pressurecoefficientsareratherdetailedandhavetobespecifieddependentonthesizeofthe
area. SOFiLOAD facilitates this task by providing the following steps:
• A reference load case contains all loaded areas with their real size as AREA loading of
TYPE WIND. For more details see record AREA.
• ForaspecificwindloadcaseonehastospecifywithrecordWINDthedirectionofthewind
and the profile of the wind speed along the height.
• Then a COPY TYPE WIND (or the default ALL) will create the detailed pressure distribu-
tions according to tables 4 to 6 of DIN 1055-4 resp. tables 10.2.1 to 10.2.4 of EN 1991-1-4
depending on the defined geometry and wind direction. A positive factor selects for those
regions with changing sign the suction, a negative factor will select the pressure value. To
define the loading areas the outer dimensions of the building are needed. As these values
may not be derived from the load areas, SOFILOAD will use the outer box of all active
groups to evaluate these values.
Hint: Thewindprofileofthedesigncodesdefinetheairvelocityalongtheheightfortheundis-
turbed flow. For a slender building this distribution will be seen on the front side (region D
according picture 7.5 of EN 1991-1-4), however the rear and the other sides (regions A,B,C
and E according picture 7.5 of EN 1991-1-4) have a rather constant suction which is refer-
enced to the nominal reference pressure at the top of the building. This is clearly stated in the
remark of section 7.2.2. (1).
For compact buildings (H/B < 1) the same effect is observed for the front side. The constant
pressure is again referenced to the value at the top of the building which is accounted for.
The staggered wind loading according to picture 7.4 of EN 1991-1-4, which is introduced with
"‘may"’ is not applicable in all cases and is not physical. Thus the default in SOFiLOAD is to
use the continuous variation. If that special load pattern is required, this can be achieved by
an input of:
3-46 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|SOFiLOAD
TVAR 'WIND_PATTERN' 2 SCOP 'LOADING'
The possible values 0,1,2 select no variation, continuous variation, staggered load pattern.
For the wave loading a COPY will create the loadings with the Morrison equation and the
defined force coefficients. A shift off the wave kinematics may be specified by the global coor-
dinates (DX,DY,DZ). However in this case an explicit scalar definition for DX (0.5[-] or 50[%])
will shift the wave by this fraction of the wave length.

Freeloadingisaveryconvenientmethodtoplaceloadsatanylocationwithinthestructureand

nodalandelementalloading. Forthispurposetheprogramwillalsoworkwithpuregeometrical
elements having no stiffness at all like the outer hull of a frame work. Eccentric loading may
create moments, but moments will not be transferred into a pair of forces by this approach.
Free point and line loadings will be applied exactly once within a system. For area loading the
algorithm for that would be extremely complicated, so it has not been implemented and there
is the chance for an area loading to be applied more than once.
3.15.1 References
If not otherwise specified (e.g. beam loading) the loading will be distributed in general via
quadrilateral elements, which may be taken from:
• General QUAD elements
• QUAD elements with NAR 0 (surface definition only)
• QUAD elements from a load distribution area
• Surfaces of BRIC elements These are defined by the active groups and with GFA the area
referencesdefinedforthenodes. Surfaceswithoutareareferenceorwithaninteriorvolume
node will not be loaded with GFA.
Forallreferencesonehastodistinguishbetweengroupbasedtypes(BGRP,QGRPandVGRP
resp FGRP) and the geometric references (GPT, GLN, GAR, GVO, GFA as well as LAR). The
geometric reference will be defined automatically with SOFiMSHC, but may be also defined
explicitly with SOFiMSHA. This information will be saved with the elements and the nodes.
The load may be specified to act only on certain types of structure. It may be useful to specify
ifaloadisintendedtobecomeabeamloadorshouldbeconvertedtonodalloads. Forcurved
reference elements it also makes a difference and the total load sum if the eccentricities are
taken relative to the curved reference axis/area or to the polygon edges of the elements.
If no element type is specified (AUTO), the program will try to use all possible reference types.
The difference is apparent for point loads, where a AUTO-load will always be attached to the
nearest node in the end, while an area or linear reference may decide, that this load is now off
the structure.
For the search of possible elements, the following rules are implemented:
• Explicit references are always unique. The load will be applied with particular reference to
the selected element.
• Referencesongeometricorelementtypeswillchoosebetweenallpossibleelementstofind
the best fit. For AREA loading this might create multiple loading within the same loading
area,forpointandlineloadstheelementsnearesttotheloadwillwin,adefinitionofWIDE

is ignored if an explicit reference REF has been given.
• ForanunspecificreferencetoageometricitemSOFiLOADwillfirsttrytousethestructural
references, but if this fails it will switch to the corresponding finite element. Thus GPT will
become NODE, GLN to BGRP and GAR to QGRP.
• For an automatic reference the program will work first on explicit load distribution areas
LAR, then GAR resp QUAD, then on GLN resp. BEAM and last on GPT resp NODE ele-
ments. The load must be within the dimensions of the element, only for the final loop over
all nodes the value WIDE will become effective. The reference MOVE will not cycle over
the nodes, thus it will discard all loads of a load train outside the structure. The LAR areas
may be ignored if required with CTRL LAR 0.
LoadingsonTRUSandCABLelementsareappliedwitharankingfollowingallbeamelements,
as these elements can not account corretcly for partial loadings or load excentricities. Thus
some selection by a reference number, a group number or a limited value for WIDE is always
necessary. This behaviour is manadatory to avoid loading on cables of an external tendon.
3.15.2 Projection of Loading Definitions
The optimum definition of loadings is exactly at the point where they are acting. But for some
structures, it is easier to define the load position by a projection. This first projection has
nothing to do with the load direction itself and should never be mixed up with that.
If no projection in global directions is selected, a projection on the loaded structural element
is assumed. For the interpolation and integration of the load values this projected geometry
will be used. If such a possibility is not available, the projection is done perpendicular to the
loading plane for LINE and AREA loadings.
As there is a limit on the magnitude of the projection window WIDE for curved load definitions,
it is required to specify the projection direction if a value for WIDE is selected.
WIDE WIDE
Figure3.7: ProjectiveloadingwithWIDE
Theloadmaybedefinede.g. withacertainoffsetfromthestructureitself. Itwillthenactonall
elements within a certain range WIDE before or behind the load plane, even those which are
perpendicular to the projection plane of the load. The load value will be interpolated within the
plane of the load definition. WIDE will not cut through the elements, it will only select them by
a logical decision to be within the range or not. The load itself can act in any local or global
direction, however. For loadings within those dimensions of the element no specification of
SOFiSTiK2023 3-49SOFiLOAD|InputDescription
WIDE is required therefor.
For the decision if a load will be attached to a specific element, the geometric size of the point
(column head or prescribed mesh size), the section of a geometric line or the thickness and
eccentricity of the area for QUAD elements will be used.
ForcurvedsurfacestheusershouldalwaysspecifythesurfaceGARiftheloadpointsarewithin
that structural area, or select a global projection if the loading is separate from the structure.
The latter will select only elements within the projection. The load type has no influence on
this process. If WIDE has been specified only elements before and behind the load area will
become loaded. A selection via GAR may also be used for projective loads, it will then select
the elements of this region, but will not affect the projection of the load values.
For the projection direction N (Default) the load will be assumed to act in the defined load
coordinates, thus excentricities may be obtained creating momental loadings. With the projec-
tion direction LOAD the load will be projected on the element as with XX, YY or ZZ. Thus no
moments will be created.
For the so called componental loadings it is to distinguish between a variant where the sign of
theloadingisintendedfortheglobalcomponentandavariantwhereitisintendedforthelocal
component. The latter of these two variants may be selected with the projections XXL, YYL
and ZZL instead of XX, YY and ZZ.
3.15.3 Beam loading
In SOFiLOAD there are different methods to deal with loading for beam structures. The most
general method is based on explicit load distribution areas LAR and will then distribute all
loads, even point loads, on multiple beams.
This method is based on load distribution influence areas, constructed from regions either al-
ready subdivided in quadrilaterals or to be established automatically in simple cases of four
edges. There is a tiny plate-bending FE-program involved creating the support forces for sup-
ported edges or edges with a beam section. These values are permanently saved to the
database.
If now an arbitrary loading is defined it will be first converted to nodal loads for the distribution
mesh of the distribution region and then within a second step it is converted to support forces
and eventually beam loading along the edges of the area.
The other methods will load only a single distinct beam for any created part of the loading
area. For point and line loads there is a hierarchic search method, where beams are selected
basedontheirdistancetotheload. Inthissequencetheloadwillbeprojectedontothebeams,
subdividing line loads if necessary. A point load will be always applied entirely on one beam.
Forarealoadinghoweveraprimaryandsecondaryspandirectionisselected(automaticallyor
explicitly). Loading will be distributed in the secondary span direction.
3.15.4 Special Hints
Coordinate definitions relative to nodes are best performed by putting the coordinates to a
variable with COOR beforehand. For simple cases for all coordinates a specification of the
literal GPT instead of the X-value and for the number of a geometric point or a node instead
of the Y-value will directly use the coordinates of that point. It is also possible to specify all
3-50 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|SOFiLOAD
coordinates relative to a special nodal point, which is given with its number and the the item
NREF for all loadings but VOLU.
With the literals DXY, DYZ or DZX instead of an X-value it is possibel to specify coordinates
relative to the first defined load point. With literals DDXY, DDYZ and DDZX the differences are
taken relative to the last load point.
It is not required to specify a load value in all load points. Missing load values will be interpo-
lated before saving the load (e.g. linear variant load value along a complex geometric curve)
The problem of multiple loading may occur if the user has defined overlapping elements or
therearemultiplenodeswiththesamecoordinates. ForPointandLINE-loadsthereisarather
easy way to assure, that no part of the loading will be applied more than once. However,
for QUAD-elements this is a very difficult task. Therefore the program will load all possible
elements. The user has to define a WIDE-value which defines all elements within a distance
WIDE before or behind the load plane will be treated as loaded. For special cases a sound
group selection may be helpful.
Forallloadingthepercentageoftheactiveloadareabasedonthedefinedloadingarearespec-
tive length will be calculated and printed. A value deviating from 100 percent will be marked.
With ECHO LOAD the generated loads may be printed and controlled.
For numerical reasons tiny load components will not bes saved. load areas with a dimension
less than the factored part of the total dimensions defined by CTRL STOL will be ignored.

Load distribution areas for beam systems can be generated with the record LAR. So it is
possible to define forces as free point, line and area loads at their action position. These
loads are converted then via load distribution areas into equivalent beam loads acting on the
corresponding beams. Other load types (momnets, temperature etc.) may not be treated.
Single beam groups can be selected with GRP1, GPR2 and GRP3. Only the selected beam
groups get then a loading. Thus e.g. a loading can be allocated only to the transverse or the
longitudinal girders within a load distribution areas. Use of all beam groups is the default.
The loading area may be defined as:
3-52 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|SOFiLOAD
• Existent QUAD elements of an area or a group
• Explicit structures trinagular or quadrilateral mesh
Every load distribution area gets a local z direction. The positive z direction results from the
definedsenseofrotationinanalogmodetotheQUADelements. Thusitispossibletousefree
loads with the load type PZ - load in local z direction.
Explicit definition of a load distribution area
An explicit load distribution area is described via three or four nodes which are the corner
points of a triangle or quadrangle. This area is subdivided in M and N elements. Either the
node coordinates or the numbers of already defined GPT points for X1, X2, X3, X4 are to be
input. Thehighestsubdivisionvalueisusedhereforthegreateredgelengthinthesmallerone
forthesmalleredge. IfnoinputforMandNwasdoneorifatocoarsemeshwasdefined,then
SOFiLOAD generates automatically a mesh.
Figure3.8: Generation
Generationa
The coordinates of the four corners may be defined in absolute coordinates or taken from a
structural node with the definition GPT nn. Further it is possible to enter for Z2, Z3 or Z4
one of the literals DXY, DYZ or DZX. The other two coordinates are then taken as increments
within the specified plane to the first point. A definition of only the first two points will create a
rectangle within the appropriate coordinate planes.
The load distribution areas should not be defined too large, because otherwise deductional
loads will arise. A load distribution area possibly with an overhang shown in the following
SOFiSTiK2023 3-53SOFiLOAD|InputDescription
pictures for a four-span bridge should be input per span.
Four-span girder with four load distribution areas
Figure3.9: Four-spangirderwithfourloaddistributionareas
In case of one continuous load distribution area deductional forces can arise in the neighbour-
ing span due to a single load.
On the other hand deductional forces are generated as planned always inside for external
loads, because they are necessary for the equilibrium.
With e.g. CTRL LAR 0.3 the stiffness of the support can be softened to reduce possible
negative support forces.
It is recommended to check the LAR areas in the ANIMATOR.

POIN is a single point load or a similar load type acting independent from the element mesh.
The program will search for points, lines or regions where to put the load.
POIN-Loads are not singel loads with a singularity at the tip, but an energetic equivalent for
loadings in the vicinity of a node of the FE mesh. If the mesh is refined at the tip of the POIN
load, the singularities become more visible. As the transverse loading of a plate or shell may
be always spreaded to the mid surface of the plate or shell, there is the following simple rule:

• Explicit references are always unique. The load will be applied with particular reference to
the selected element including eccentricities if possible.
• For an unspecific reference to a geometric item. SOFiLOAD will first try to use the geo-
metric references based on their dimensions, but if these fail SOFiLOAD will switch to the
corresponding FE-element. Thus GPT will become NODE, GLN to BGRP and GAR to
QGRP.
• For an automatic reference the program will work on LAR/GAR resp QUAD, then on GLN
resp. BEAM and last on GPT resp NODE elements.
If the reference is NODE with an explicit number, the defaults of the coordinates will be those
of that point. Eccentricities will generate moments at the node.
For REF GLN/BGRP the eccentricities will be copied to the beam loading if beams become
active or transformed to moments in case of lines without beams.
For REF GAR/QGRP the load will always converted to up to four nodal loads without any
eccentricities.

For the influence areas the loading will generate a dirac-delta strain within the centre of the
elements. Load value will be 1.0 in general. The deformation of the mesh is the required
influence area. However, directly in the point of interest the FE- approach will smooth out the
singularity of the theoretical influence area.

LINE and CURV describe a polygon or a curved smooth line load, which follow
• a sequence of elements (LINE without geometry)
• a mesh independant polygon (LINE with geometry)
• a mesh independant curve (CURV with geometry)
Distribution of load values may be either explitly or obtained from a spline along the defined
load direction.
If the reference SLN,EDG or BGRP is used with an explicit number NO, the coordinates may
be omitted. The load is then uniform along the whole line. For the first two types non uniform
load distributions may be selected with NREF.
For EDG the polygonal geometry of the line will be used, while SLN follows the real curved
geometry. If a SLN has been subdivided only in parts with beam elements, the load will be
applied only on those generated beam elements. If the total line should be loaded, either
coordinates have to be defined or the REF EDG has to be used to generate nodal loads only.

The offset is the value of WIDE plus the radius of a circle or half of the thickness of a plate.
Otherwise it is possible to define up tp 63 load points. As there are possible only 6 per record,
the following points have to specified with continuation record with load type CONT:

It is recommended to use as few points as possible.
For the projection of the load there are the principal possibilities:
• ExplicitreferencetoageometriclineorEdge/BoundaryElementInthatcaseallcoordinates
areconvertedrelativetothatlineandtheinterpolationofalldatawillbedonealongtheline.
Two load values thus define not a standard linear loading geometry, but a loading with a
linear varying distance quasi parallel to the line. That’s why all the load points have to be
able to be projected on the SLN geometry. The load per length will be referred to the SLN
length. For any Xi it is possible to specify the literal S or SX, then Yi will be taken as the
station or true length along the structural line. If Yi is defined as factor via unit [−] or [%],
the values are taken as fraction of the total line, negative values are always taken in the
inverse direction relative to the end of the line.
• References on geometric lines without explicit numbers. In that case all nodes of lines will
be projected onto the loading geometry. If the projected points are within the width of the
line or the extensions of the section, the load segment will be projected back to the beam
or edge. Load values and eccentricities will be scaled to fulfil the global equilibrium.
• References on beams, truss or cable elements In a first step all beams will sorted by their
distance to the loading. Then the beams are projected on the loading geometry and the
loading segment is projected back to the beam, applying scaling as in the point above.
Loads to far away from the sectional geometry or before or behind a beam will not be
applied. If multiple element types may be selected, they are selected in the sequence
beams, trusses and cables.

In all cases the program has a sort of Hidden-Line algorithm to ensure that no part of the
loading is active more than once.
FortheloadingonloaddistributionareasorQUAD-Elementstheprogramproceedsasfollows:
• A projection of the loading will be done into the requested region if a GAR reference type
has been chosen. All calculations will be done within the projected area. Load segments
will be treated only for the area itself.
• Ifaglobalprojectionisselected,allcalculationswillbemadeintheglobalprojectiveplane.
The load may hit several elements which should be selected via the WIDE item.
• Without projection and reference area the projection will be done into the local element
plane.
• For an automatic reference the program will first work on areas and then on lines.
At the element level of a QUAD even curved loading lines will be converted to straight seg-
ments. As long as a data-point is within a QUAD element that will establish no problems, but
if the curved geometry touches the element only slightly this will not be considered further. A
finer mesh will create different load patterns for those cases therefore.

does not need to be specified in all points, missing values will be interpolated with a least
square distribution accounting for the load projection definition. Thus up to four points with
a suitable pattern will define a bilinear (4 coefficients) distribution, more points will allow a
quadratic (6 coefficients) or bicubic (10 coefficients) distribution, but sufficient points have to
be defined in at least two directions to allow the evaluation of all coefficients. If this is not the
case, the highest degree is selected which yields unique coefficients without further notice.
Kinks in the load values have to be defined via separate load areas.
Loadingonareas(e.g. fillingswithliquidsandsilos)maybedefinedwithVOLUveryefficiently.
If a constant loading on all elements of an area is to be defined, it is possible to define a
GAR/LAR/QGRP only with an explicit number NO and the load value P1. All coordinates may
be omitted in that case.

specified with continuation record with load type CONT:

TYPE CONT P1 TO P6 ! for the points 7 to 12
TYPE CONT P1 TO P3 ! for the points 13 to 15
...
END
Hint
When using CONT none of the records must contain generation or list expressions!
Further it is possible to enter for X value from the 2nd load point one of the literals DXY, DYZ
or DZX. The other two coordinates are then taken as increments within the specified plane
to the first point. A definition of only two points will create a rectangle within the appropriate
coordinate planes.
For the projection of the load there are the principal rules:
• Explicit references to an area is always unique. However if the number is not defined, the
programwillcheckallareas. Somultipleinstancesoftheloadedareamightoccur. However
only those areas are used, where the load is completely within the volume defined by the

The difference between PXX and PXP is given by the fact, that PXX is a load referenced to
the true area (e.g. dead weight) while PXP is referenced on the projection into the XY-plane
(e.g. snow). However, for planar systems there will be no difference as the loads are always
referenced on the true surface. The component loadings define a load direction derived from
a projection of the normal of the area into the specified global projection plane (e.g. diverting
forces of tendons). The local loads based on a global load projection are required to define
earthquake loadings on fillings of tanks. A load type PXPZ will define a horizontal projecting
pressure applied in the normal direction Z of the plane. In general the sign of the load value
will be taken on the global component. However with projection XXL, YYL or ZZL the sign of
the load value will define the local component. Thus specifying PXPZ on a circle with PROJ
XX will define a load acting depending on the orienation of the local z-axis, while PROJ XXL
will define a load acting everywhere in the same direction e.g. inwards.
ForloadtypesPandMequivalentnodalforcesandmomentswillbeestablishedbyintegrating
the element shape functions.
For all other loads, creating initial stress (like temperature) over the whole element, the selec-
tion will be by hitting the loading area with the centre of the element. This is why for irregular
meshes the sum of the loading area might deviate from the 100 % aim.

3.19.1 Wind loads
Loading on areas with TYPE WIND have some special effects. In general the load values
specified are the pressure coefficients, but when using the COPY command, an area may be
subdivided and changed according to the provisions of the EN 1991-1-4. Deviations of DIN
EN1991-1-4 resp. DIN 1055 Table 11/Pict 12 as well as BS EN 1991-1-4 are included. The
details are controlled by the specified TITL.
• If the title is not defined or starts with the letters "CP", no conversion will be performed.
• If the title tarts with the letters "QP", the pressures according to the design code will be
createdwhichcanbeusedthenwithLARareasforbeamsystems,otherwisetheloadtype
WIND will be unchanged.
• If the title contains the text ’MEAN’ the pressures will be created as before, but based on
the mean values.
• A number after a colon at the end of the title is used for flat roofs as follows:
>0 The height of an Attica in m
<0 Thereductionoftheeaveseitherwithanangleindegreeortheratioofacurva-
ture r/h
There are of course some requirements on the geometry of the loading areas:
• The loading require the total outer extend of the building, defined by all groups active for
wind loading.
• A planar load area may have as many load points as possible, but all points have to be
defined, that they are counter clockwise if you look from the outside on the surface.
• A double pitched roof (saddle or through) requires at least six load points. The first point
has to be on the ridge or groove, which is required to be horizontal and the inclination of
the roof must match along all edges everywhere.

to check the load values especially if the wind attack is not perpendicular to the structure.

It is possible to enter for X1, X2 or X3 one of the literals DXY, DYZ or DZX. The other two
coordinates are then taken as increments within the specified plane to the first point.
A geometric description like the LINE and AREA loading is not available, because this would
be to much effort. Therefore the selection of elements is only by a sheared cube, defined by
three selectable directions p1-p, p3-p2, p5-p4, which must not be colinear.

The load values will be interpolated within the sheared coordinate system and added for all
three directions. In most cases it will be sufficient to define only load values P and P1 and to
use the other four points only to limit the loading ares. If the user does not supply coordinates
for a direction, the program will try to add the maximum extent in the gravity direction for P1
and the missing perpendicular directions for the other oints and treat the load value as an
increment.
For the common case of a fluid pressure it is thus sufficient to define the free surface (X or Y
or Z) and the weight of the fluid at entry P1.

3.22.1 Eigen Stress and Equivalent Linear Temperature Load
An input of a temperature profile along the sectional local z-axis followed by the EVAL TEQV

uniform temperature change DT (ΔT eq) and an equivalent temperature difference in local z-
direction DTZ (ΔT z,eq).

where α t(,y,z) is the thermal expansion coefficient and ΔT(,z) is the temperature change
distribution.
The temperature distribution is always uni-axial defined only in z-direction. For more complex
problems a thermal analysis with HYDRA for a FE-section should be done.
The temperature induced strains will cause corresponding axial constraint stresses, which are
not in equilibrium in general.
σ t(,y,z)=−E(,y,z)·εt (,y,z)=−E(,y,z)·α t(,y,z)·ΔT(,z) . (3.18)
The resulting axial force of the beam under the constrained conditions due to thermal strains
can now be determined as

If these total strains will be applied as loading on a flexible system, deformations are obtained
which will change the stresses. For a better understanding, these loadings are converted by a
reference thermal expansion factor to equivalent thermal loadings, The constant temperature
change ΔT cons will result in the axial force, while the linear temperature change ΔT ne(y,z)
will cause bending moments to appear. Without any constraints all forces will become zero
and only the eigen-stresses which are self-equilibrating (i.e. they do not contribute to internal
reaction forces in the beam) will remain.
ThusanytemperaturedistributionΔT(z)canbedecomposedintoaconstant (uniform),alinear
and a remaining non-linear part (see Fig. 3.12).
It has to be noticed however that for a composite section a unique reference value of the
thermal expansion coefficient is used and the residual stresses will have jumps at material
boundaries. Thus a simple addition of the temperatures is not possible in that case.

4 Dynamic Loads
Dynamic loading may be accounted for among others with
• static equivalent loading
• response or power spectra
• via a transient analysis with time functions.
Inallcasesyouneedaloading,inmanycasesgeneratedbysomeunitaccelerations(ACCE).
A spectrum defines the response for a single degree of freedom system depending on the
eigenfrequency period and may be used for systems with multiple degrees of freedom with
statistical algorithms.
For a dynamic analysis one or more load cases will be combined via time functions to a com-
plete loading, which is then subdivided into discrete time steps. The tasks to do are:
• Definition of the spectra (RESP)
• Definition of time functions (FUNC)
• Creating of loads for the single time steps (STEP)
The last task is much more effective for linear dynamics (DYNA) within the time stepping al-
gorithm, but for more general cases, like nonlinear dynamics with non conservative loading it
will become necessary to save all the loading within the database for ASE with the command
STEP.

4.1 Pushover Analysis - Theoretical Background
Seismic design of structures is a challenging and demanding task for a structural engineer
and the tools at his disposal range from a relatively simple multimodal response spectrum
analysis (RSA) which has been incorporated into almost all modern seismic design codes to
a rather complex and expensive direct nonlinear response history analysis (RHA). Despite its
accuracy and rigorousness in estimating the seismic response of structures, direct nonlinear
response history analysis still remains impractical for a wide range of problems encountered
in earthquake engineering practice. On the other hand, the multimodal response spectrum
analysis with its use of the estimated average ductility capacity based mostly on the type of
the structure often provides a too crude estimation of the nonlinear seismic demand. In recent
years, a turn from RSA towards performance-based seismic design based on the nonlinear
staticprocedure(NSP)orpushoveranalysis hasbeenevident. Thisprocedurerecognizesthe
fact that the capacity of the structure and a seismic demand are two inseparable parts of the
performance-based design.
Pushover analysis is a procedure whose purpose is to evaluate the performance of the struc-
ture under a specified earthquake hazard by comparing the available capacity and estimated

Pushover analysis procedure comprises of the following stages (Figure 4.1):
1. AQUA + SOFIMSHA/SOFIMSHC: First stage is the definition of the material properties,
orwhatismorecommoninthepushoveranalysisdefinitionofnon-linearlinkelements,or
plastichinges(seeAQUA:SMAT).Nextthesystemisdefined,withappropriatenon-linear
links assigned to e.g. ends of the beams.
2. SOFILOAD: Next stage is the definition of the pushover lateral load case pattern. Choice
of the load case pattern is an important point in the pushover analysis since these lateral
forcesshouldbeabletorepresenttheinertialforcesthatthestructurewillbeexperiencing
whensubjectedtoearthquakegroundmotionasaccuratelyaspossible. Theloadpattern
is usually assumed to be proportional to some assumed displacement shape vector ϕ.
Most commonly, the chosen load pattern is proportional to the fundamental eigenmode
of the structure. However, any other reasonable displacement shape ϕ can also be used
(e.g. constant or linear distribution of forces, etc.). Instead of a load driven pushover
analysis, a displacement driven analysis might also be required (Figures 4.11 and 4.12).
For more details about the definition of the pushover load see ACCE: Pushover Load.
3. ASE: Pushover analysis is performed by subjecting the structure to a monotonically in-
creasingloadpatternoflateralforcesdefinedinstage2. Asaforementioned,theselateral
forces represent the inertial forces that the structure will be experiencing when subjected
toearthquakeexcitation. Thegoalofthisincrementalnonlinearstaticanalysisistoobtain
the capacity of the structure.
4. SOFILOAD: Based on the previous stages the structural capacity can be analyzed to-
gether with the seismic demand and the structural seismic performance can be deter-
mined.

citationswithagrowingintensity. Thebase-shearforceV bandcontrolnodedisplace-
ment  cnod can be taken as a measure of these maximal forces and corresponding
maximal displacements of the structure, respectively. As noted in Reinhorn [2], it
can be shown that envelope of all force maxima and their associated displacements
are close to the curve obtained by monotonically increasing the inertial forces and
determining the associated displacements (pushover curve).
The procedure consists of the following steps:
(a) Choosing the characteristic force and displacement of the structure, a so called
pushover curve of the multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system can be obtained. The
force,heredenotedasV b,isusuallybase-shear,whilethedisplacementisadisplace-
ment of the characteristic point on the structure  cnod, also called the roof displace-
ment or the control node displacement (Fig. 4.2).
HowtopassthepushovercurvetoSOFiLOADisdescribedinSubsection: VB-U:Base
Shear - Control Node Displacement Diagram.
(b) Next step in the pushover analysis is the transformation the original MDOF system,
whose nonlinear behavior is described by the pushover curve, into an equivalent
single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system. In doing so, we can also transform the
pushover curve into the so-called capacity diagram, plotted in the spectral displace-
ment - spectral acceleration coordinate system, also know as ADRS format.
Starting point is the equation of motion of the nonlinear MDOF system
M·¨(t)+C·˙(t)+ƒ s()=−M··¨ g(t) , (4.1)
where (t), ¨(t) and ¨(t) are the relative displacement, relative velocity and relative
acceleration vectors, respectively, while M and C are mass and damping matrices of
the structure. ƒ () denotes the nonlinear internal resistance force of the structure.
s
Right hand side represents the effective earthquake forces, where  is the unit direc-
tional vector and ¨ g(t) is the ground acceleration.
First and basic assumption in the formulation of an equivalent SDOF system is that
the deflected shape remains constant during the entire structural response to ground
motion, regardless of the level of deformation (Krawinkler and Seneviratna [3] and
Fajfar [4]). In that case, the relative displacement vector of an MDOF system can be
SOFiSTiK2023 4-3SOFiLOAD|DynamicLoads
approximated as follows:
(t)≈ϕ·q(t) , (4.2)
where q(t) represents the modal coordinate, according to the terminology used in the
modal analysis.
ϕT
Substituting Eq. 4.2 in Eq. 4.1 and premultiplying with yields
ϕT ·M·ϕ·q¨(t)+ϕT ·C·ϕ·q˙(t)+ϕT ·ƒ s(q)=−ϕT ·M··¨ g(t) , (4.3)
or written in a more compact form
m·q¨(t)+c·q˙(t)+ƒ s∗(q(t))=−m∗·¨ g(t) . (4.4)
In modal analysis m = ϕT ·M·ϕ and c = ϕT ·C·ϕ are usually called generalized
modal mass and damping. This is general true only if the assumed displacement
shape ϕ correspondstooneofthenaturalmodes,butforconveniencesakethesame
terminology will be used herein regardless of the chosen displacement shape. ƒ∗ =

SDOF system.
Introducing a new reference SDOF displacement D(t) as follows
q(t)=·D(t) , (4.5)
we finally obtain the equation of motion of the equivalent inelastic SDOF system
m∗·D¨(t)+c∗·D˙(t)+ƒ s∗(D(t))=−m∗·¨ g(t) , (4.6)
where c∗ =·c denotes the damping of the equivalent SDOF system.

If the earthquake ground acceleration ¨ g(t) is know, the solution of this equation can
be obtained by the numerical integration. However, in most practical applications the
seismic excitation is usually represented by the earthquake (elastic or inelastic) re-
sponse spectrum. The maximal response of the SDOF Eq. 4.9 is then given by
m|D(t)|=S d(T∗,ξ∗) , (4.10a)
m|A(D(t))|=S p(T∗,ξ∗) , (4.10b)
where S d(T∗,ξ∗) is the spectral relative displacement response and S p(T∗,ξ∗) is
the pseudo-acceleration spectral response 2.

ment D m(t) = S d, which a SDOF system might exhibit during a series of seismic
excitations with a growing intensity. As noted in Reinhorn [2], it can be shown that
an envelope of all force maxima and their associated displacements is close to the
monotonic curve represented by the capacity diagram 3. This implies that the time-
dependent nonlinear resisting force - displacement behavior, ƒ∗(D(t)), of the SDOF

Now we can transform the V b −  cnod pushover curve of the MDOF system to the
S p−S d capacity diagram of the equivalent SDOF system (Fig. 4.3).

Considering the Eqs. 4.2, 4.5 and 4.10a the absolute maximal displacement of the
control node of the MDOF system  cnod can be related to the spectral relative dis-
placement response S d(T∗,ξ∗)

To complete the transformation the base shear V b needs to be related to the pseudo-
accelerationspectralresponseS p(T∗,ξ∗). Thiscanbedonebyfirstrecollectingthat
the vector of pushover loads p is defined by (see ACCE: Pushover Load)
p=M·ψ· , (4.14)
where  is a parameter which controls the magnitude of the pushover loads. The
distribution of the pushover loads is governed by the vector ψ. It is reasonable to
assume that the vector ψ can be approximated by the assumed displacement shape
ϕ. Consequently, the assumed pushover load and displacement shapes are mutually
dependent, which is the assumption which is used in the majority of the pushover
analysis approaches (Fajfar [4]).
Base shear V b of the MDOF system is

V b =(cid:88) p  =T ·M·ϕ·=m∗· . (4.15)

Equations 4.13 and 4.18 are used to convert the V b −  cnod pushover curve from
the stage 4a to the SDOF system spectral acceleration S p - spectral displacement
S d coordinate system to obtain the capacity diagram (Fig. 4.3). The corresponding
SOFiLOAD input is described in A-D: Spectral Acceleration - Spectral Displacement
Diagram.
Hint
Two main assumptions used for the conversion of the MDOF into an equivalent
SDOF system are:
• Displacement shape remains constant during the entire structural response
to ground motion, regardless of the level of deformation
4-6 SOFiSTiK2023DynamicLoads|SOFiLOAD
(Hintcontinued...)
• The distribution of the pushover loads is proportional to the product of the
mass and the displacement shape (pushover load and displacement shapes
are mutually not independent)
(c) Elastic response spectrum can also be transformed from the traditional spectral ac-
celeration S  versus period T format to the spectral acceleration S  versus spectral
displacement format S d (a.k.a. A-D format or ADRS format) to obtain the elastic de-

How to pass the the elastic demand response spectrum to SOFiLOAD is described in
Subsection: A-D: Spectral Acceleration - Spectral Displacement Diagram.
(d) Next step in the structural seismic performance analysis is the determination of the
performance point (a.k.a. target displacement, demand point, etc.). The performance
point defines the internal state (internal forces, displacements, rotations, interstory
drifts, etc.) of the structural system under an earthquake demand. To determine the
performance point, the capacity and elastic demand diagram in A-D format are plot-
ted in the same graph. Then based on the available capacity the elastic demand is
reduced to obtain inelastic seismic demand for the equivalent SDOF system. The
intersection between the capacity and the inelastic demand diagram represents the
performance point (S dp,S p) (Fig. 4.5). In other words, the performance point corre-
sponds to the structural state.

In formulating and solving the equivalent inelastic SDOF system (Eq. 4.6 or 4.9) and
determiningtheinelasticfromtheelasticseismicdemand,twomethodsaremostcom-
monly used:
i. Method based on the elastic highly damped demand spectrum and an elastic
SDOF system with equivalent damping and period. This method is also know
as the capacity spectrum method (ATC-40 [5], Freeman, Nicoletti, and Tyrell [6],
and Freeman [7]). Underlying principle behind this method is described in ATC:
ATC-40 Procedure.
ii. Method based on the inelastic demand spectrum and an inelastic SDOF system
(EN1998-1:2004 [8], Fajfar [9], and Chopra and Goel [10, 11]). Underlying princi-
ple behind this method is described in EC8: Eurocode 8 Procedure.
5. ASE + WINGRAF: Once the performance point is computed the structural demand of the
original MDOF system can easily be established. Back transformation of the inelastic
seismic demand of the SDOF system represented by the performance point (S dp,S p) to
the MDOF system ( cnod,p,V b,p) is performed with the help of the Eqs. 4.12 and 4.18,
i.e.
 cnod,p =ϕ cnod··S dp , (4.20a)
V b,p =2·m·S p . (4.20b)
Now the performance of the original MDOF system at maximum control node displace-
ment  cnod,p can be evaluated on the global and local level. In other words the MDOF
structure is pushed up to the target displacement level of the the control node  cnod,p
(displacement demand).

Pushing the structure until reaching the target displacement level of the control node
 cnod,p is performed with ASE analog to the stage 3. If the pushover analysis in the
stage 3 is performed with the reasonably small load increments then the user could take
one of the two load cases in between which the control node displacement level  cnod,p
is located as the final performance (demand) load case.
Finally the global structural performance can be assessed by performing checks that the
structural and nonstructural components are not damaged beyond the acceptable limits

Earthquake loading is defined in most design codes as a basic acceleration dependant on the
importanceofthebuildingandtheseismiczone. Theresponseofthestructureisthendefined
as a response spectra depending on soil classes and the magnitude. RESP allows not only
the selection of the standard spectra, but also variants with explicit parameters. For special
cases even an individual curve may be defined with succeeding FUNC records.
Forthecompleteloadingdefinitionyouneedthedirectionoftheaccelerationspecifiedwiththe

record ACCE. Please note that the spectra may be defined in absolute accelerations or as a
fraction of the gravity acceleration g or a base acceleration  g. The second approach is more
straight, as we have the theoretical value of 1.0 for T = 0 (perfect rigid structure). Thus this
approach is chosen for all spectra beside the UBC and the Chinese and Japanese spectra. It
might happen that SA is less than 1.0 for some design codes due to soft soils.

4.2.2 Uniform/International Building Code UBC/IBC
UBC and IBC distinguish the soil classes A to E and the special class F with individual param-
eters.
A Soil Profile Type A (Hard Rock)
B Soil Profile Type B (Rock)
C Soil Profile Type C (Very Dense Soil and Soft Rock)
D Soil Profile Type D (Stiff Soil Profile)
E Soil Profile Type E (Soft Soil Profile)
F Soil Requiring Site-specific evaluation
The IBC defines in detailed maps the basic acceleration for a short period S s and at 1 sec S 1.
Fromtheseandthesoilclassallparametersofthespectraaredefinedaccordingtoequations
16-38 to 16.43. The user specifies this by the soil class and a literal of the form s.ss/t.tt for the
seismic zone, where s.ss and t.tt are the values for S s and S 1.
For the UBC the Zone-Factor is derived from table 16-I according to the seismic zone value 1,
2A, 2B, 3 or 4. From that table 16-Q and 16-R yield the values C  and C . The near source
factor of table 16-S and 16-T as well as the modifications for isolated systems in zone 4 have
to be specified with parameters explicitly.
The acceleration you have to specify at ACCE is then for both cases required to be given as
g=10.0.
Hint
SOFiSTiK2023 4-13SOFiLOAD|DynamicLoads
(Hintcontinued...)
Modification of the UBC/IBC spectra with a factor η based on the modal damping ξ (Eq.
4.27) or the behaviour factor q (Eq. 4.28) is not supported.
4.2.3 DIN EN 1998-1/NA:2021-07 and DIN 4149 (2005 and 1981)
The response spectra acc. DIN EN 1998-1/NA:2021-07 are available with the input TYPE
DIN, which requires the definition of the refrence peak ground acceleration agR for AG and
the selection of the geological underground ratio (A-R, B-R, C-R, B-T, C-T, B-S or C-S) with
the CLAS input. Spectral acceleration SP,R in the plateau region of the response spectrum
for the underground ratio A-R will be calculated then from the peak ground acceleration by
multiplying it with the factor 2.5. Subsequently, the values of the periods TB , TC and TD and
the soil factor S will be determined for the return period of 475 years.
Hint
The relevant parameter acc. DIN EN 1998-1/NA:2021-07 is the spectral acceleration
SP,R in the plateau region of the response spectrum for the underground ratio A-R. The
refrence peak ground acceleration agR for the input AG should be calculated by dividing
SP,R with the factor of 2.5.
DIN4149(2005)(TYPEDIN4)hasthreeearthquakezoneswith g =0.4, 0.6 and 0.8m/sec2
and the spectra follows closely the EC, but with a much more narrow shape. Due to the
separation of the soil in the upper soil classes (A,B,C) and a geological underground class
(R,T,S) the possible values for CLAS are A-R, B-R, C-R, B-T, C-T or C-S.
The old DIN 4149 (TYPE RDIN) however has a rather simple spectra for the seismic zones 1
to4withaccelerationvaluesof 0.25, 0.40, 0.65 und 1.0m/sec2. Thosevalueshoweverhave
to be multiplied with a soil factor between 1.0 and 1.4 and thus should be explicitly given via
ACCE.
4.2.4 SIA 260 and ÖNORM B 4015
SIA(TYPESIA)knowsaboutelasticandinelasticspectrasimilartoEC.Thebaseaccelerations
for the seismic zones 1a, 1b, 2, 3a and 3b acc. SIA 261-2020 have the values of 0.60, 0.80,
1.00, 1.30 and 1.60m/sec2. The seismic zones and the soil classes acc. SIA 261-2003 are
available with the TYPE SIA3.
AnexplicitdefinitionofD>1.0willselectthedesignspectra. Theimportancefactorγ r maybe
accounted for either by a modified SA-value or as safety factor within the superposition.
TYPE SIA3 without a soil class specification defines the spectrum of the old SIA 160 for
medium stiff soils, where we have the value of TC = 0.5sec, which should be changed for
stiff soils to 0.33sec.
For the ÖNORM B 4015 (TYPE OEN) the default is the spectra for medium stiff soil. You have
to specify the corresponding accelerations with ACCE.
4.2.5 Italian NTC according DM-2008
The Italian design code defines in an appendix (Allegato B) for every individual location the
followingvalues: Abaseaccelerationag,apeakfactorF0 andareferencetimevalueTc*. The
4-14 SOFiSTiK2023DynamicLoads|SOFiLOAD
spectras are classified according the soil class and the topological situation. Thus we have to
specify:
• Topografic situation: TYPE NTC1, NTC2, NTC3 und NTC4
• Soil class: CLAS A,B,C,D und E
• Zone: Values for F0 and T∗ separated by "/"
c
(e.g. 2.50/0.21)
• AG: Basevalue of acceleration
(in g/10≈m/sec2)
All time values and spectral response values are then established based on these values. If
AH is specified as 0.0, the vertical spectra will be generated.
4.2.6 Greek Code EAK (1999)
In Greece (TYPE EAK) there are the seismic zones I to IV with basic accelerations of 1.2,
1.6, 2.4 and 3.6 m/sec2. The acceleration ah you have to specify at ACCE is then this value
multiplied with the importance factor γ1 of table 2.3. Soil classes are defined as A, B, (= C)
andΔ(=D)andaspecialcategoryX.Forthefirstfourthetimevaluesfromtable2.4arepreset
by the program. Behaviour and other factors have to be incorporated for SB by the user.
4.2.7 Russian Code SNiP II-7-81 (1995/2000)
In Russia there were soil classes I to III which lead dependant on the layer thickness to
response spectras (eq. 3 to 5) numbered CLAS 1, 2 or 3, in 2000 these formulas have
been changed , addressable with CLAS I or II. The acceleration to be defined via record
ACCE, is given by formulas 1 and 2 dependant on the type and importance of the building
as  h =K 1·K 2·A·K ψ·η k. Values of 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 for AG will be preset according to Zone 7,
8 or 9.

In Fig. 2 elastic spectra for several soil classes are given and reduction factors for damping
ratios in Table 3, which may be selected by several RESP records. They are the same for all
seismic zones (ag), Importance (I, Table 6: 1.5 for important buildings, 1.0 for all other) and
Response reduction (R, Table 7, values between 1.5 and 5.0). The acceleration you have to

According to this code there are two levels of earthquake, Level 1 (JRA) with high probability

4.2.10 Chinese Code GB
AccordingtoappendixAoftheGB50011-2010wehaveintensitiesandgroupsofdesignearth
quakes (1,2,3) specified for all locations in China. Then we have to distinguish between a
frequently and a rarely earthquake. So we have the following types:
GBF1 Frequently Earthquake of 1st group
GBF2 Frequently Earthquake of 2nd group
GBF3 Frequently Earthquake of 3rd group
GBR1 Rarely Earthquake of 1st group
GBR2 Rarely Earthquake of 2nd group
GBR3 Rarely Earthquake of 3rd group
According to Table 3.2.2. the basic accelerations are given according to the seismic intensity
6, 7, 8 or 9 with two subclasses as factors of g as follows:
Intensity 6 7, 7a 8, 8a 9

the SMIN value.
According to old GBJ 11-89 (TYPE GBJ) Table 4.1.4-1 there are the earthquake influence
factors preset for the earthquake intensities 6, 7, 8 and 9 with values of 0.04, 0.08, 0.16 and
0.32 . Thus the spectra is referenced to the maximum value SB=α m. The shape of the
spectra is given in picture 4.1.4 (SA=0.45SB, K1=0.9, TD=3.0) and the value of Tg = TC has
to be selected by the user according to table 4.1.4.-2:

4.2.11 Wind spectra
With RESP it is also possible to define wind spectra. These spectra define the turbulence
dependent from a scalar frequency (e.g. Monin coordinate). While the generic type WIND
allows to define a spectrum individually with FUNC, it is possible to select the well known
spectra with an additional item at CLAS. (see also WSPE)

The latter is done in DYNA by associating to a load case with a wind spectrum individual load
vectors to every eigen form with MODB in record LC. The load values should be specified
according to the coherence distribution with a pressure value of q 0 ·k p ·, the product of the
mean pressure q 0 with the peak factor k p and the turbulence intensity , which can be done
with Record WGEN.

4.2.12 Modal Coordinates
Whenevaluatingspectraespeciallyforwinditispossiblethatexplicitmodaldisplacementsare

modal loadings via the masses:

k k k k
This deviation is not necessary in DYNA. With RESP EXMC the q k factors may be defined
directly with consecutive FUNC records where the number of the mode has to be defined
instead of the time value.
The scaling of the eigen forms has to be selected properly. If default (modal masses = 1.0)
has not been used, the definition of an appended character can select the direction where the
maximum component should be assumed to be 1.0.

Each load case may obtain free selectable time functions for dynamic response analysis. A
load function may be defined in different ways:
• As a discrete polygonal function given by several pairs of data values (T,F). The first time
value is the start time. The function will be zero before the first or after the last time value.

SOFiSTiK2023 4-19SOFiLOAD|DynamicLoads
• If a phase value or TMIN is defined the function becomes a periodic function with the
general period T. For time values less than TMIN or greater TMAX the function value is
zero.

4.3.1 Functions for Pedestrians
If an impact factor S is given, a periodic loading typical for pedestrians is applied. The load
value ”number of persons times 0.8 kN” must then be specified with the load itself:
If this factor s is defined within the range from 0.0 and +1.0 or as the literal WALK, the four
values and phases given by Seiler/Hüttner (Bauingenieur, 2004, S. 483-496) are preset, but
the coefficients (F1 etc.) may be specified explicitly. Values between -1.0 to 0.0 selects the
three coefficients and phases according to Bachmann (Vibrations in Structures, IABSE 1987).

4.3.2 Aperiodic Functions

specified by an extra function. Three common shapes of functions may be selected explictly

The time T defines the total duration, while the time values T1, T2 and T3 define the duration
of the three phases (Plateau, Lead-In, Lead-Out). The factors F2 and F3 define the shape of
the lead-in and lead-out according to the above formulas.

4.3.4 Ground accelerations
If FUNC is used to describe diskrete ground accelerations, it might be very usefull to apply
a so called "base line correction". Stochastically generated or measured accelerograms may
introduce a drift when beeing integrated, resulting in large displacements or velocities at the
end of the time integration. A definition of the time value TBLC will modify the function to get
rid of these deviations at that time value.
The output of that function will show six curves: The acceleration and the integrated velocities
and displacements of the original and the corrected function.

every storey individually if the storeys have different horizontal dimensions. The user may
therefor restrict the forces with a BOX (XMIN to ZMAX) to those nodes within that box.

Pushover Load
In order to perform the pushover analysis the pushover load must be defined first. Pushover
load case must contain additional information (e.g. participation factor, modal mass, displace-
mentshapevector,etc.) whichneedstobesavedinthedatabase. Thisadditionaldataislater
used in the pushover post-processing stage where the pushover performance is determined
(see PUSH). Therefore pushover load is defined and the necessary additional information are
saved in database by specifying negative value for LINF.
Dependingonthetypeofthepushoveranalysis-force ordisplacement controlled-twopossi-
bilities for the definition of the pushover load exist:
1. Forces - loads as external forces p. These loads are specified by selecting NODE as
TYPE in the ACCE-command (Figure 4.11c).
2. Displacements - loads as prescribed displacements of the nodes . These loads are
specified by selecting DISP as TYPE in the ACCE-command (Figure 4.11d).
Thepushoverstaticloadshouldbeabletorepresenttheinertiaforcesthatthestructurewillbe
experiencingwhensubjectedtoearthquakegroundmotionasaccuratelyaspossible. Theload
patternisusuallyassumedtobeproportionaltosomeassumeddisplacementshapevector ϕ.
Most commonly, the chosen load pattern is proportional to the fundamental eigenmode of the
structure. However, any other reasonable displacement shape ϕ can also be used (Figure
4.12).

Figure4.12: Pushoverdisplacementshapeϕ
For the displacement based pushover analysis (TYPE DISP), the load as the prescribed dis-
placements  is directly taken from the specified displacement shape vector ϕ (Figure 4.11d),
that is
=ϕ . (4.43)
If the loads are in form of forces (TYPE NODE; force based pushover analysis), the displace-
mentshapevectorisadditionallyweightedbythemassmatrixMinordertosimulatetheinertia
forces (Figure 4.11c), i.e., the load pattern p is
p=M·ϕ . (4.44)
Hint
The mass matrix M is based on the masses which are currently active, i.e. which are
specified before the current SOFiLOAD block. It is therefore recommended to run one
ASE/DYNAeigenvalue analysiswith allthe necessaryadditional massesprior tothe def-
inition of the pushover loads, in order to ensure that the correct mass matrix is taken into
consideration.
Displacement shape vector ϕ is defined by specifying negative number of the load case con-
tainingdisplacementsofthenodesfortheLINF.Forexample,ifthedisplacementshapevector
corresponds to some eigenvector which is previously computed and stored in e.g. LC 9001,
the input would read (Figure 4.12a)

• Acceleration spectra in
random phase values (based on the load case number) will be generated and with the help
of an intensity function will yield an accelerogram, adjusted with a target damping D to the
response spectra with an iterative process. The base acceleration AG has to be selected
to match the spectra. The default is 9.81 (cid:2)m/sec2(cid:3) . However the most common case is
to switch off the scaling of the accelerogram altogether. This can be achieved by specifying
the negative value for AG (e.g. SIMQ ... AG -1) (see sofiload.dat/english/simq.dat). If
the value AG is specified as 0.0, the function of the power spectra is created instead of the
accelerations.
Hint
It is strongly recommended, as a way of checking the validity of the generated accelel-
ogram, to always calculate a response spectrum from a generated accelerogram and
compare it with a target spectrum (LSPE). This can be achieved with the help of the
command REVA (see sofiload.dat/english/simq.dat).

This is done by the response analysis of a single mass oscillator within a given frequency
range. Then the maximum results depending on the frequency or period are visualized.
If the LFUN has been established by a transient analysis with DYNA, it is strongly suggested
to use the total accelerations. These can be only obtained if the loading is defined as accel-
eration. (see ACCE) A transient analysis with eqvivalent forces will not allow to add the base
accelerations to the results.
For TYPE one can also enter P+, S+, V+, A+, AA+ as well as P-, S-, V-, A-, AA-. Then
only the positive or negative components are evaluated. In the case of excitation through an
acceleration, TYPE AA can be used to plot the total acceleration (ground+oscillator). This is
usually the desired value. Without a specification for TYPE the original function is shown.
The duration of the evaluation is determined by the highest time value of the excitation value.
A somewhat longer time range with exciting function 0.0 should thus be defined in the case of
high frequency excitation.

The method is based on the elastic highly damped demand spectrum and an elastic (linear)

inwhich,asaforementioned, ξ str isviscousdampinginherentinthestructureand ξ 0 isequiv-

Commonwayfordeterminingtheequivalentviscousdampingofthelinearsystem ξ 0 fromthe

where E D is the energy dissipated by damping of the inelastic SDOF system and E S is the
maximum strain energy of the system.
The hysteretic energy E D can be determined from the capacity diagram (Fig. 4.16). First the
bi-linearrepresentationofthecapacitydiagramattheperformancepointPPcanbeestablished
by equating the area underneath the capacity curve E c (Fig. 4.16a) and the area underneath

coordinates of the performance point PP (S dp,S p), i.e.
E D =4·(cid:0)2E C−S dp·S p(cid:1) . (4.54)
E S is the maximum strain energy of the system at the displacement S dp and with effective
stiffness k eƒƒ =ω2 eƒƒ. From Fig. 4.16c it follows
k eƒƒ ·S2 dp, S dp,·S p,
E S = = . (4.55)

Once the values of the E D and E S are know, we can determine the ξ 0 and ξ eƒƒ from the Eqs.
4.52 and 4.51.
The damping modification factor κ is measure of the extent to which the actual hysteretic be-
havior of the structure can be represented by the parallelogram of Fig. 4.16c. It is intended to
take into an account the cyclic degradation effects such are the stiffness and strength degra-
dation and the pinching effects. It depends on the hysteretic behavior of the structure charac-
terized by three types (Table 4.12):

• Type A (SBTA) represents stable, reasonably full hysteresis loops.
• Type B (SBTB) represents a moderate reduction of the loop area.
• Type C (SBTC) represents poor hysteresis behavior with a substantial reduction of the
loop area (severely pinched and/or degraded loops).

The principle idea behind the method is the solution of the equivalent inelastic SDOF system
with the help of the inelastic demand spectrum. The equivalent SDOF system represents the
idealizationoftheMDOFsystem,whosenonlinearbehaviorunderearthquakeischaracterized
by the pushover curve obtained in the incremental nonlinear static analysis (Fig. 4.20), as
described in Section 4.1.

The performance point represents the solution of the Eq. 4.60 and the main outcome of
the analysis described herein. It can be described in different coordinate systems:

tem (A−D)
• PP (T p,S p): SDOF Spectral Acceleration - Period coordinate system (A−T)

Formulasgoverningthetransformationbetweenthesecoordinatesystemsaredescribed
in Section 4.1, Stage 4 and 5 of the pushover workflow.
In order to determine the performance point PP, the period T∗ and the nonlinear resisting
force ƒ∗ of the equivalent elastic SDOF system need to be related to the performance point
s
coordinates S dp and S p.
As shown in Section 4.1, Stage 4b, the time-dependent nonlinear resisting force - displace-
ment behavior, ƒ∗(D(t)), of the SDOF system can be characterized by the time-independent
s
monotonic maximal nonlinear force - maximal deformation relationship ƒ s∗(S d) of the SDOF
system (capacity diagram, Fig. 4.21a) used in the response spectrum solution (Eq. 4.11).
The most common approach to solve the nonlinear Eq. 4.60 is to idealize the maximal nonlin-
earresistingforce-maximaldisplacementrelationshipƒ s∗(S d)(capacitydiagram)byabi-linear
modelwiththeinitialstiffness,k∗ =ω∗2 andayieldstrengthlimitƒ∗. Thebi-linearidealization
sy
of the capacity diagram according to EN1998-1:2004 [8] is an elastic-perfectly plastic function
(Fig. 4.21b). The influence of moderate hardening is incorporated in the demand spectra
(Fajfar [4]).

4.9.2 SPL - Structural Performance Limits
The performance point is used to compare the global response of structure and individual
component deformations to limit values in context of the specific performance objectives for
the building in question. The performance objective represents the desired building perfor-
mance level under a given seismic hazard (earthquake ground motion). The performance
levels are defined by the performance limits (ATC-40 [5]). The structural performance limits
can be categorized as:
• Local element and component acceptability limits. Each component (beam, column,
slab, connections, etc.) of the structural elements (frames, seismic walls, diaphragms,
foundations, etc.) should be checked to verify if its response under a given seismic
demand (level of forces and deformations corresponding to the performance point) is
within the acceptable limits (performance limits). Local performance limits for beam
plastic hinges can be defined in AQUA (see AQUA: SFLA).
• Global structural performance limits. Similar to local performance limits it is possible to
define the global performance limits. Up to five global (structural) performance limits
can be specified by the user (PUSH ... SPL1 ... SPL5).
The following input will set the global structural performance limits (SPL1-SPL5) as the  cnod

of stations (s) which defines an alignment of the lanes to each other.
There are three principal approaches for the problem of finding the most unfavourable load
position:
• One can generate numerous load cases with the train load at distinct positions and search
for the maximum with the superposition tool MAXIMA. For some load definitions this ap-
proach is not possible with acceptable effort however.
• More general one can establish the influence lines for the forces and moments of all or
selected locations within the structure. In a second step these influence lines may be eval-
uated with the load trains. The result are direct extreme values of all forces and moments.
This is performed with the program module ELLA, highly optimized for this task.
• LastnotleastatransientanalysisoftheloadcoursingthestructurewiththeprogramDYNA
is possible. For the animation of this process the record TREX is very helpful.
Depending on the system and the loading, the one or the other method will be better. Spe-
cial effects like a load which is not bound to the lane in transverse direction (EC) or having
independent wheels (DIN) may increase the number of needed load cases considerably.
The commands available for the load train definition are:
TRAI Specifying the load train
TRPL, TRBL Explicit loading of a load train
With this commands no loading will be applied to the structure yet. The load definitions are
saved under a load case number which should not be used otherwise. It is the SOFiLOAD
/ COPY command that will transform the train to individual loading. With a reference to a
geometric line (GAX) and an associated lane (LANE) the following transformations will take
place:
• The load train will be adopted to the geometry of the lane.
• Centrifugalloadingwillbecreatedbasedonthespeedofthetrainandthecurvatureofthe
lane.
• Variable eccentricities will be applied automaticallly in an unfaourable way.

5.2 Load Groups
There are possibly different combination coefficients within one load train. Therefore we have
load groups within the EN 1991-2 or the DIN FB. For road bridges they are given in table 4.4,
for railway bridges in table 6.6. From these definitions the following table is deducted:
Traffic area
type vertical loads horizontal loads
model LM1(TS) LM1(UDL) LM4 braking centrifugal
gr0 Charact.
grU Charact.
gr1 Charact. Charact. (*) (*)
gr2 frequent frequent Charact. Charact.
gr2n frequent frequent non frequent non frequent
gr2f permanent permanent Frequent Frequent
gr3 Charact. on

gr4 Charact. UDL
on total area
gr5 LM 3 charact. LM 1 frequent
in main lane on other lanes
gr6 0.5 Charact. 0.5 Charact. 0.5 Charact. 0.5 Charact.
The selection of a group will select individual factors for the components from a complete load
train definition. gr6 is used for the exchange of supports according to DIN FB. For all combi-
nations with other than the characteristic values the PSI1-coefficients of EN 1991-2 resp. BS
EN 1990 are used. Other coefficients for the additional LM1 may be specified with coefficients
PSI1 (TS) and PSI2 (UDL) in the train’s LC record. But the loading of the special vehicle will
always be taken without those coefficients. All other deviations to this have to be build up with
the special groups and an explicit factor FACT.
Appendix C of DIN FB 101 states also for road bridges ("if not specified otherwise"):
• LM2 and the single loads on pathways should not combined with any other life load
• Neither snow nor wind should be combined with braking or load group gr2 or gr3.
• Snow or wind actions larger than ψ o*FWk should not be combined with gr1 or LM1.
• Wind and temperature should not be applied together.
The life load groups for railway bridges 11 to 31 according to table 6.6. of DIN FB 101 should
be best evaluated with ELLA or MAXIMA and not with combined explicit loading. For those
bridges, wind and life load are bound together, thus should act only at the position where the
5-2 SOFiSTiK2023TrainLoading |SOFiLOAD
train is, but only if the wind load does not exceed a certain threshold.

The total loading area will be subdivided in up to 99 individual traffic lanes relative to a given
geometrical axis. These may be created automatically by a predefined standard section or
with explicit coordinates. One may subdivide each segment with different widths and dynamic
impact factors. All lanes have to be defined together to an existing axis, any new definition will
delete all previously defined lane definitions.
5-6 SOFiSTiK2023TrainLoading |SOFiLOAD
Figure5.2: Singlelaneloadedandresidualarea
The width of the lane is defined through the left and the right boundaries. The lane can be
widened or narrowed by different input data at different stations. If the lane edges happen to
intersect the lane, this should be defined only at distinct points to allow for correct treating of
torsional loading.
The width of the load train may be less than those of the lane. In that case additional basic
areas are established loaded by a constant load specified with the load train. If the load train
is larger than the lane width, reductions of the applied loading are possible.
The lane 0 has to be defined always, for the following procedures two cases have to be distin-
guished:
• There is only lane 0, the width of the moving loading is defined only by the load train. Only
then, the eccentricities of the load train are applied absolutely for all lanes.
• There are other lanes within the curb stone limits. Then lane 0 defines the total extend of
thetrafficloadincludingpathways. Thewidthofthemovingloadisthemaximumextendof

The description of all available load trains can be found within the next pages. If a value for
the convoy distance is given (XCON), the specified train will be applied multiple times with
that given minimum distance between the last load ordinate and the reference point of the
consecutive load train.
The the residual area loading P5 is applied without dynamic impact factors and without cen-
trifugal forces. It is applied only for:
• Areas between the constant width of the load train and the polygonal bounds of the lane.
If the load train has no width (WIDT 0) there won’t be a residual area either (Railways)
• Areas between the borders of lane 0 and all other lanes (e.g. pathways)
• The total lane area for the load group GR4 (e.g. pedestrian bridges)
The wind loading is generally equal to P6 and acts horizontally upon a traffic band with height
P7. As there will be no traffic for strong winds, this is not the maximum wind load on the
structure itself. The sign of the wind load is defined as positive if coming from the right in the
moving direction, but option DIRT allows a more specific definition. ELLA has the possibility in
record POSL via OPT to apply the wind load in the most unfavourable direction at its own, if
DIRT has allowed this. Both options are combined with a logical ”and”-operation.
ThefactorPFACisamultiplieringeneralforallloadelementsoftheloadtrain,itmaybeused
for classified LM71 or SW/0 loadings. (e.g. a value from the list 0.75 - 0.83 - 0.91 - 1.00 - 1.10
- 1.21 - 1.33 - 1.46 from EN 1991-2 6.3.2(3)).
The factor PFAV specifies the factor for favorable loadings (see e.g. EN 1990-2 GRP 13/14
and 23/24). For road train loadings this factor will be applied only for the wheel loadings. The
default for railway load trains is 0.0 for the LM71 and 1.0 for all other load trains. The default
forthemajorityformostotherroadtrainsis0.0. Forloadtrainsforroads,thosefactorsmaybe
specified only with individual load train definitions.
Theeccentricityoftheloadtrainwithinthelaneshouldonlybedefinedwhenapplyingtheload-
ing. Only for the wide heavy load trains (LM3, HB etc.) an explicit eccentricity of that loading
may be defined a priori. The definition of YEX in TRAI is intended to describe the eccentricity
for railway loadings according EN 1991-2 6.3.5., predefined with r/18 in any direction.
The load trains have a moving direction which is not only important for some of the train loads
but also for the direction of the braking load. Positive load values are considered to be braking
loads in traveling direction, negative load values are accelerating loads in reverse direction. If
SOFiSTiK2023 5-11SOFiLOAD|TrainLoading
DIR N is specified, no impact factor will be applied and the brake and velocity and wind load
will be preset to zero. Also in this case some filters are available in ELLA.

For an analysis with multi-body-dynamics it is possible to generate masses, beams, springs
and dampers via the record TREX. The mass of bogie and wheel may be specified either as a
positive absolute load value or as a negative fraction of the total mass. For more information
see record TREX.

is given, the dynamic factor will be set equal to the value with a minimum length and the width
of the lane will be set equal to 0.0.
Dynamic coefficients according to appendix E of DIN FB 101 are dependant on the frequency
of the structure and should be specified explicitly therefore.
DynamiccoefficientsaccordingtotheFrenchFasciculeNo. 61section5.5dependontheratio
G/S of the permanent to the maximum loading. If this formula should be taken this ratio has to
be specified instead of the impact factor PHI.
5.5.2 Centrifugal Forces
In case of a curve, the mass of the loading, usually derived from the vertical load, is used
together with the speed of the train and the curvature of the lane to compute the centrifugal

load components.
The forces calculated according to the laws of physics with vin [ m/sec] are:
2
P ƒ =P · ; g=9.80665 m/sec2 (5.11)
Rg
Sometimes there is an equivalent formula in the design code for a speed in [ km/h] with a
factor of v2/(127R).
These forces will be replaced for Eurocode and BRO as follows:
According to Eurocode EC 1-3 4.3 (independent from v)
Q tk =0.2·Q  (r <200m) (5.12a)
Q tk =40·Q /R (200m≤r ≤1500m) (5.12b)

These forces will be replaced for BS as follows:

These forces will be changed for railway loadings UIC as follows:

5.5.3 Load Trains according to Eurocode
The position of the loading according to Eurocode along the traffic lanes is free. Thus a syn-
chronizationwithsecondary lanesshouldnotbeapplied. Fortheassessmentof globaleffects
(EN 1991-2 4.3.2) each tandem system should be assumed to travel centrally along the axes
of notional lanes. With a definition of YEX, ELLA may apply this excentricity value in both di-
rections. But the minimum distance of 0.5 m between adjacent loading cannot be checked by
ELLA, but will be satisfied in almost all cases if the width of the lane is at least 2.5 m.
Thedoubleaxleshouldbeappliedonlyintotal. Thusallloadsoftheaxleswillbeappliedeven
if one is favourable.

The upper limit is defined by the requests of the STANAG, it may be redefined by a national
annex or other means. This may be specified via a global variable EN1991-2_QLMAX in the
INI-file or via TVAR in the section loading.

The variants with an axle loading of 240 kN are wider than the default lane. Thus, it is in

As the coefficients ψ 1are different for UDL and TS, we use from this load case the value ψ 1for
TS, but for UDL and the residual loding the default value of 0.4 of the EN will be taken.
Load Model 3 (NA BS)
NA to BS EN 1991-2:2003 defines different types of this load model. The distance to the
residual loading in the lane has been reduced to 2.5 resp 5.0 m. As every axle has a different
dynamic amplification factor, these will be applied directly if V is larger than 5 km/h.
Load trains of the Special Types General Order (STGO) will be selected with TYPE SV, where
P1 defines the class (80, 100 or 196), P2 is not used and P3 defines the central distance
(values of 1.2, 5.0 and 9.0 m are common). All other remarks especially about P4 remain

Those classical load trains are used in several countries in Europe (DIN 1072, OENORM B
4002, Spanische IAP and Brasilian NBR). National variants may be selected with a country
code. The width of the moving loading is 3.0 m in general, for the OENORM it is 2.5 m and for
the Spanish IAP a minimum distance to the secondary truck suggests a width of 4.0 m. The
rest of the traffic band is loaded by P3, the remaining areas inside the lane are loaded with
the basic area loading P5. With DIR N one may select a secondary lane without any dynamic
factors.
The definition of a second load train beside with P2 und P4 can not be supported for some
of the recent features. It us strongly recommended to use synchronized lanes instead, it is
required to use two lanes with individual load trains instead. The loading in the second lane
requires the value of P5 defined for P3 and the impact factor to be deactivated with 1.0.
All loads are divided to portions to the right and to the left of the lane axis, which can act
independently.

themagnitudepudependingonthelengthoftheloading,andeitheraconcentratedload(KEL)
P1=120 kN or a tandem loading with P1=148 kN (with distance P2, default 1.2m). The value
of P4 defines the loaded length L. If P4 is not given, L will be calculated in ELLA based on the
sum of the distances of the null points of the influence line.
The value pu is calculated from the total loaded length L
• up to L = 50 m:

(5.17)
• from L = 50 m (and for the tandem loading):
p=36·L−0.1
(5.18)
It is then possible that shorter loaded lengths could lead to higher forces. As this can not be
treated easily, ELLA uses an approximation by evaluating an effective length according to BD
37/01 figure 11. “Base lengths for highly cusped influence lines”. In a first step the integral
of the total positive and negative contributions of the influence line will be evaluated, then the
effective length is caluclated:

The loading HB and NB consists of a heavy loading and a simultaneous traffic band load.
P1 = 30.0 (Default Axle loading class)
values between 24 and 45 are possible, axle loading is 10 times P1
In some countries very similar load trains are used (South Africa, Israel). These Variants will
be selected with type NB or the selected country code:
COUN = GB BS 5400 with distances 1.8 and x = 6.0, 11.0, 16.0, 21.0 or 26.0 m
COUN = ZA TMH7 NB with distances 2.0 and x = 6.0, 11.0, 16.0, 21.0 or 26.0 m

BS5400makesadistinctionbetweenfourpositionsoftheHBloading,whichaffectthemagni-
tude of the traffic band load. These are controlled by the factor P3 and the eccentricity P2:
P3 = 1.000 ; P2 = 0.0 HA-UDL simply centred
P3 = 2.000 ; P2 = 0.0 HA-UDL doubly centred
P3 = 1.333 ; P2 = +a/4 HA-UDL full to the right, 1/3 to the left
a = nominal lane width
P3 = 1.333 ; P2 = -a/4 HA-UDL full to the left, 1/3 to the right
a = nominal lane width
The value P3 of the latter load varies with the length P4 according to the loading HA.
TheDepartmentalStandardBD37/88hasotherfactors(Table14). ThedefaultvalueforP3will
be selected based on a nominal width bLof 3.048 m and the first lane.
TMH7 applies the NB vehicle not combined with other life loads. Values P2 to P4 will be
ignored.

between the first and second axle. If the train travels in both directions it is distributed in two
separate blocks at both ends.
P8 = 0.25 (HB)
P8 = 0.20 (NB)
Hint
The basic area loading P5 is not deducted in the case of HA and HB loading. It always
acts upon the full width of the lane.
Load Train HC, NC
TMH7 knows also a NC loading. This is defined by two blocks of varying width, length and
distance. If the variation of this loading becomes to complex a definition with individual block
loads with TRBL may be useful.

The IS 1227 has a load train HC, which is very similar to the HB. The axial load of the last two
axles is augmented by a factor of 2, the distance x is exactly 13.0 m.
5.5.7 Live Loads according to AASHTO
The Loadtrain HL-93 may be selected in a SI and an US Version, as the load values are not
completely equivalent.
Old loading according AASHTO has three loading classes 10, 15 and 20, derived from the
gross weight of a two axle loading in tons. Beside the orginal two axle load train (HS), there
is a three axle load train (HT) with a variant spacing, a uniform loading an single or tandem
axles.

The value P1 defines the level of the load train (CL, CL4 = only 4 axles, CL3 = only 3 axles)
The definitions ON, ON4 and ON3 select the variants for Ontario according Annex A14.4.
The definitions BC, BC4 and BC3 select the variants for Britisch Columbia. The definition MV
selects the maintenace vehicle according 3.8.11.
The value P2 defines the class of the load train (default 625).
If the value P3 is defined ( 9.0, 8.0 or 7.0 for class A, B or C and D) a constant lane load will
be defined with reduced load values of the load train without any dynamic allowance. For this
loading a braking load P8 of min(700,180+0.1*L) will be applied. So P8 should become zero
for secondary lanes.
The height of the wind attack area P7 is 3.0[ m] , the zentrifugal force is acting at P9=2.0[ m]
aove the lane.
The value P4 defines the fixed distance to the 4th load of the vehicle, it is 6.6 in general, but
up to 18 m in British Columbia.
Further wit Literals EP1 and EP2 the special load trains EPLL1 and EPLL2 may be selected.
The value P8 defines a factor on the braking load which is applied as 180+0.1*P3*L but not
larger than 700 kN distributed along the total length. P8 0.0 deactivates this type of loading.

minimum distance to the load reference point may be defined with DPOS. For the evaluation

The loading has a vertical component P, a longitudinal component PB and two components in
transverse direction. The load may be defined either as single point load, as a pair of wheels
(Definition of B < WIDT) or as distributed load (Definition of BW only or B equal to WIDT) The
truedimensionofthewheelcontactareaisonlyusedforCOPYwithinSOFiLOAD,ELLAuses
only the resultant forces for the evaluation of the influence lines.
Positive loadings of PB are braking loads acting in travelling direction, negative values are
intended as accelerating loads in the reverse direction. Loads are applied at the height of the
lane.
The centrifugal loading acts in the height hs, the constant horizontal force in the height zw,
thus creating torsional moments. If the load has a width B, this moment will be applied as a
pair of forces on the lane surface, a torsional moment along the lane axis will be generated
otherwise.

For more complex cases the load train may be modelled with finite elements in the classical
way (beams, springs, dampers, masses). Then TREX needs not to be used, but the train and
all its loads should be specified with a user defined TRAI and each single TRPL should have
its contact node properly assigned.

6 Wind Loading
6.1 General
Wind is a randomly non deterministic dynamic loading. The flow of the air induces a velocity
pressureonthestructure. Dynamiceffectsofnaturalwindaremainlyintroducedbyavariance
of wind speed and thus wind pressure within time and space.
The complex action of wind is a combination of mutually influencing effects like:
• Wind climate (the global wind)
• Topology and roughness of terrain (the local wind)
• Aerodynamics, aeroeleasticity (drag coefficients and wind force derivativa)
• Structural dynamics (response of the structure)
• Design of the structure
TheprogramSOFiLOADallowstotakeintoaccountandtosimulatemostoftheaboveeffects.
Tousethesefeaturestwoextralicencesareneeded: SOFILOAD-Wforthestaticwindloading
and SOFILOAD-WH for the dynamic wind loading (especially WGEN) and NONL-DYN for the
interaction analysis in DYNA.
Asbasicsafetyconceptforthewindloadedstructureitwillbespecifiedinthedesigncodesor
especiallyforlargeprojectsinthesubmissionthatwithinagiventime(e.g. 50or100years)the
failureofthestructurewillbeavoidedwithagivensafetyfactor. Theanalysisitselfwillbebased
on shorter interval - in Europe: 10 minutes - which includes the maximum wind speed of the
50-year-wind but is long enough to allow a considerable dynamic response for all resonance
frequencies. The wind speed within that interval may be described as the sum of
• a timely constant, but spatial variant basic mean wind speed (10-minute-wind) and
• a superimposed timely and spatial variant part of turbulence.
The treatment of dynamic wind effects is governed by the fact that turbulences may be only
described by statistical means: The real time-spatial wind speed is within the statistical limits
purely random. The usual analysis methods use probabilistic analysis with power spectras
(Ruscheweyh [15], Dyrbye and Hansen [16], Rosemeier [17], and Davenport [18]). As these
methodsdonotusethetimebuttheenergycontentofthewindspeeds,theyyieldclearandre-
liablebasicsfortheanalysis. Severalstepsthenprovidethepowerspectraofthedeformations
and forces within the structure. The probabilistic peak value will be the result of an extremal
analysis of the spectras. At the time being, most of wind loaded structures will be analyzed
via this approach. And all modern design codes for wind use these methods to obtain wind
pressures.
National and international Design codes nowadays however use strongly simplified methods
(ECCS [19, 20]) [ 11, 12, 13]. The total map will be subdivided with 3 or 4 wind zones with
step-wise wind speeds. To facilitate the usage, several wind parameters will be set up on the
safe (unfavourable) side naturally. The complex structure is reduced to a simple single one
degree of freedom oscillator. Even then working with wind loads is still difficult. Compared to
the efforts, the results will be unsatisfactory in numerous cases: The total dynamic effects will
SOFiSTiK2023 6-1SOFiLOAD|WindLoading
be accounted for with a constant gust factor for the total structure which might be rather faulty
for individual elements. Structures with several sensible frequencies (skeletons, towers with
antennas,pedestrianandothertypesofbridges)arenotapplicableforthissimplifiedapproach.
The same holds for structures with tuned damping elements and many more cases.
Thecompletespectraldesign-thesocalledstochasticanalysis-israthercomplexandcostly,
it is thus applied only for very sensitive structures (cable stayed bridges with large spans). On
the other side the stochastic analysis is still underestimating the ultimate load, because the
spectral methods are purely linear for the structure and especially for the wind loads and do
not account for any nonlinear effects. The linear relation between the angle of attack and the
wind force coefficients are seldom admissible. The stochastic analysis is further unprecise for
systems with close eigenfrequencies (e.g. tuned damper systems). Further more it has only
limitedpossibilitiestoaccountforinteractivity(dynamicresponseofthestructureanditseffect
on the wind pressures or forces).
SOFiLOADhasbeencreatedtocopewithmoredetailedandthusmoreeconomicwindloading
for the design of structures, overcoming the above limitations. Two of the benefits of the new
method to be stated are:
• SOFiLOAD uses the ESDU procedure to generate wind profiles accounting for the envi-
ronment of the structure - roughness, elevations - similar as but more precise than it is
foreseen partially in the most recent design codes like EN 1991-1-4.
• DYNA evaluates more precise forces and moments via transient analysis, accounting on
onesidefornonlineareffectslikechangesofthewindforceswhenthecrosssectionrotates
and on the other side for interactive behaviour like aerodynamic damping, potential flutter,
galloping and torsional galloping or discrete damping elements.
The second method is based on a mathematical turbulence generation which creates a se-
ries of random transient wind histories. The structure will be imposed via program DYNA to
that wind history and the development of deformations and forces will be recorded and su-
perimposed by statistical means to get the extreme values along the time interval. The total
methodology has been developed in the years 1992 to 1994 (Kovács, Svensson, and Jordet
[21], Kovács and Andrä [22], and Kovács [23]) and has been applied since then to many large
buildings, bridges and towers.
6.2 Wind Profiles
The wind in great heights is coherent and will be dominated only by global meteorological
conditions. Nearthesurfacetheroughnessoftheterrainwillinduceanatmosphericboundary
layer, where the wind speed is zero at the ground and will approach the limit asymptotically.
In SOFiLOAD this limit value is called "atmospheric wind" which is not in correspondence with
the general literature.
The basis is the boundary layer model from Deaves and Harris, which is also part of the ISO
4354:2009. It is combining a logarithmic profile with extra terms in larger heights accounting
forCoriolliseffects. BytheeffectoftheCoriollisforceswehavearotationofthewinddirection
by 10 to 45 degrees over the height, which will be neglected here.
The SOFiLOAD-user may create the wind profile - as the first method - by defining the appro-
priate atmospheric wind speed. To facilitate this we have provided a a global wind map for
6-2 SOFiSTiK2023WindLoading |SOFiLOAD
the 10 min wind with a return period of 50 years. This wind map has been established by us
using older wind maps and meteorological measurements. It allows a smooth interpolation of
the atmospheric wind andis therefore more elaborate than therough subdivision of staggered
wind pressures of the older design codes.
As the newer design codes are based on a continuous wind profile, it is recommended to use
as a second method the reference mean wind profile to specify the wind profile.
Forspecialapplicationslikelargeandsensitivestructures,bridgesandtowersitisalsopossible
to define explicit wind profiles.
The transformation of the atmospheric wind speed defined for a 50 year return period to an-
other time value - as it might needed for large bridges - has to be performed by the user if
needed. A rather good estimate is given by:
1+0.12·lnN
V N ≈V 50· (6.1)
1.47
The distribution of the wind speed over the height is depending on the terrain roughness and
topology. Within SOFiLOAD it is possible to define a distribution of roughness (WROU), along
thewindluvdirectionupto200kmandgeometricsimplifiedelementslikeahill,edgeorridge.
For the latter there are estimates given in the literature, especially in Eurocode 1991-1-4, and
in the newest EDIN 1055-4, having been implemented in SOFILOAD.
SOFiLOAD establishes from the wind definitions all other characteristic wind data which are
relevant for the description of the natural wind or the generation of the artificial wind histories
later on. The result of the wind profile thus has the following elements
• theprofileofthemeanwindvelocities(Vmean,10-Minutes-Wind),generallycalledthewind
profile;
• the profile of the 5 s - gust wind velocities;
• the profile of the longitudinal, lateral and vertical turbulence components, defined by

6.3 Windforce Coefficients
These are the static wind force values for a given shape of a body also called aerodynamic
coefficient (to be distinguished from the aeroelastic derivativa) yielding the forces for a uni-
form velocity field or the steady state equivalent value of the relative velocity of a structural
component to the wind field. The definition for a plane section is as follows:
F=C·q·A (6.4)
with:
F Wind force (Drag, uplift, Windmoment)
q velocity pressure
C = C D, C A, C M: Wind force coefficient
A Wind attack area or width for linear elements
For extended analysis it is also possible to define the Derivativa according to Scanlan. These
define frequency dependant forces on the structure induced from the movements of the struc-
ture in the air.

The wind force coefficients for the element types beam, cable and truss may be defined within
AQUA for any section depending on the angle of attack. This definition is strongly recom-
mendedforalldynamicallysensitivestructuresorelementssensitiveforgallopingorflutter. To
obtain those values it is common practice to perform wind tunnel tests or use a CFD (Compu-
tational Fluid Dynamics) analysis.
For standard steel shapes or buildings there are values given in the literature or the design
codes. AQUA generates for steel shapes simple functions depending on the angle of attack
but without any information about galloping. SOFiLOAD has all values for rectangular and
circularsectionsavailable. ThelatteraredependentontheroughnessandtheReynoldsnum-
ber. Without any specification an enclosing rectangle is assumed or in special cases only the
component in wind direction is considered with a coefficient of 2.0.
SOFiLOAD has also the possibility via records BEAM, TRUS and CABL to define additional
factors to the defined force coefficients selectively for for those type of elements individually.
FurtherthereistherecordGRPwithadditionalfactorsavailabletodefineshadowing,influence
ordinates etc.
For areas it is possible to define in SOFiLOAD via AREA or QUAD explicit wind pressure or
uplift values perpendicular to the area. For cylindrical shapes according to many codes and
for planar standard roofs and walls according to DIN 1055 Teil 4 values may be selected. If no
such values are defined, all coefficients are taken to be 1.0.
If the pressures are defined in several data points from a wind tunnel test, the record WIPT
allows a comfortable method with an external FE-mesh of the data points to generate the
required loading data. Especially in case of transient loadings, this method is strongly recom-
mended.
SOFiSTiK2023 6-5SOFiLOAD|WindLoading
6.4 Turbulences and Aerodynamics
The natural wind is the sum of the mean wind velocity and the variances due to turbulence
which might be decomposed in three directions within the wind coordinate system:
• longitudinal (= parallel to the mean wind velocity)
• lateral (horizontal inclined to the wind direction) and
• vertical
The turbulence is then the sum of an infinite large number of small harmonic velocity frequen-
cies. Their distribution along the axis of frequencies is characterized by a power spectra.
The power spectra are the deterministic part of the wind load, the real kernel as the Fourier-
Integraloftheturbulencetimehistory. Thepowerspectraofthenaturalwindmaybedescribed
by simple formulas according to the general pattern of the Karman spectra definition. If one
chooses then a random phase distribution for all the frequencies, it is possible to reconstruct
the Fourier-Integral of a clearly defined random time history and thus the time history itself.
This is exactly what SOFiLOAD does when generating a wind history.
The ratio between the turbulence in different locations in space are characterized by special
similarity or coherence functions. These functions define in a coarse sense the relation be-
tween gust wind velocity, the duration of the gust and the size of the gust. It is clear that
the spatial distribution of the gust has a large influence on the forces within the structure.
SOFiLOAD works with natural sizes of the gust which are otherwise overestimated in most
design codes considerably. (Davenport’s model with constant size of the gust in all heights).
Thecoherencealgorithmofthewindhistorygenerationhastoreflectthatthesimilaritybetween
twonaturalwindhistoriesintwopointsmustbecomesmallerwithlargerdistances. Thisdecay
of correlation is described in the literature in different ways depending on the author of the
publication, but may be generalized by the use of the half value distance (Kovács, Svensson,
andJordet[21]),wherethesquarerootofthecoherenceofthestochasticprocesshasreduced
fromthefullvalueof1.0(fullcoherencewithdistancezero)toavalueof0.5. Eachturbulence
along any of the axis has the same function of similarity. Thus the coherence of the natural
windisdescribed bya3by3 matrixofthehalfvalue distances. Formoredetailssee notesfor
the record WSPE.
6.5 Response Dynamics
SOFiLOAD generates from the wind profile, the turbulence spectra, the coherence and some
random numbers artificial random wind histories, based on the theoretical considerations in
Kovács,Svensson,andJordet[21],tobeusedthenwithintheprogramDYNAwithatransient
dynamic analysis of the structure. By applying a sufficiently large number of such histories it
is possible to establish a statistically based proof of the ultimate state limit or a serviceability
state limit including any material or geometric nonlinear effects available.
Such a design based on transient analysis facilitates the design process of a structural sys-
tem against wind loading to a great extent. Instead of a simple dynamic gust factor we have
dynamic forces and stresses available for all points of the structure which might be introduced
intothedesignprocessdirectly. Byrepeatingtheprocessforareworkedstructureitispossible
6-6 SOFiSTiK2023WindLoading |SOFiLOAD
to optimize it for the wind loading criteria.
The first step of a wind analysis is always a static wind load (basic load case), introducing all
values needed for the wind history generation. Based on this data the random time histories
will be generated in a second step within time and space.
The transient analysis in DYNA is nonlinear by using the nonlinear wind force coefficients de-
fined within AQUA. The analysis is interactive as it is considered that the structure will move
within the wind field and will thus modify the relative wind speed in all cases by a vectoral su-
perposition of the structural and the wind velocity. Only by this feature important aerodynamic
effects may be simulated like aerodynamic damping or the bending galloping excitation.
The aerodynamic damping is introduced into the simulation with the den-Hartog formulas, i.e.
as a stationary approach automatically. (It should be noted here, that despite the important
effectitishardlyaccountedforinGerman designcodes)Alsothebendinggallopingexcitation
is automatically introduced in the analysis if the wind force coefficients have been properly
defined in AQUA.
The more enhanced possibilities to check for torsional galloping and general flutter are only
available with the inclusion of the Scanlan derivativa.
Last not least it should be pointed out, that the treatment of critical wind effects is also a
complicate matter of safety definitions (see e.g. Kovács and Andrä [22]). This manual will not
state any rules for that, the user will need to find its own demands for that purpose.

6.6 Atmospheric Wind Map
Figure6.2: 50-Year-Wind/10-Minute-Meanvalueoftheatmosphericwindvelocityininfiniteheight
The theoretical background of this map is the 2D wind profile from ESDU [24, 25]. The term
atmospheroc wind is the asymptotic value for the wind profile allowing to extrapolate from the
wind in low heights the velocity in the atmosphere. The same term will be addressed in ESDU
[24, 25] as gradient wind, UG. However for UG there are more contradictory definitions in the
literature (e.g. as the wind speed in a height of 300 - 500 m for a roughness of the surface of
0.05). The new name should allow to distinguish this meaning from the other definitions.
The sources (see Bibliography; meteorological measurements, maps within the design codes)
normally refer to a height of 10 m above ground and other reference parameters. The atmo-
spheric map has been extrapolated from these data.
There are differences between the data. We had to judge on the reliability of the data and will
6-8 SOFiSTiK2023WindLoading |SOFiLOAD
give more details about our selection:
Germany
In the region of north and Baltic sea, there are sufficient meteorological measurements in
Schmidt [26]. The statistical evaluation by the "Deutsche Wetterdienst" have been slightly
modified (reduced Weibull coefficients)
IntheregionofthenorthseatherehasbeenagoodmatchbetweenmeasurementsinSchmidt
[26]andspecificationsinECCS[19],ECCS[20]andtheregionalvaluesin[ 13] . Theregional
valuesofEurocode[ 12] /Ahoweverappearedmuchtohighandhavebeenignored(numbers
from [ 12] /A are from the very first version of [ 13] .
Control calculations for the German costal regions have shown that the roughness for the
offshore region with strong winds may be chosen to 0.005 m. SOFiLOAD will use this value in
all cases. design codes however quite often use 0.01. So it might happen, that the program
will evaluate 6 to 8 % higher wind speeds for locations at the coast. This is also valid for all
other coastal regions. To get closer to the design codes it is recommended to add a region
with the roughness of 0.01 before the building.
ForcentralGermanytheECCSisolinesECCS[19],ECCS[20]areratherontheconservative
side. Thisisnotonlycomparedwithfrenchdesigncodes(ahighjumpattheboarder)[ 12] /A)
butalsocomparedtoCaspar[27]. AtRhineandinthePfalztheisolineshavebeenadoptedto
the regional values of France. For eastern parts of central Germany mainly the evaluations of
Caspar[27]havebeentakenintoaccount. ThevaluesfromCasparhoweverhavearatherhigh
variationoftheyearlymaximum,astheauthorhasaccountedforsomeconfidentialcorrections
due to insufficient measurement data. The isolines are based on a mean variation value of 12
% (Davenport suggests in general 10 %).
In Central Europe thus we have slower wind speeds than those of the design codes. On the
other side some values of the Caspar papers show that it is much more important to account
for the local topology.
South of the line Freiburg - Nuremberg the maps of ECCS [19], ECCS [20] have been used.
the values are rather close to the DIN assumptions.
France
Base was the regional map in [ 12] /A. Between the regions we have interpolated. Compared
to [ 12] /A the maps in ECCS [19], ECCS [20] show unrealistic high wind speeds. (20 %
deviations). [ 12] /A shows, that the wind speed at the Biscaya is considerably lower than that
of the North Sea.
Great Britain, Ireland
Derived form the map ESDU [24]. There is a good match with [ 12] /A. The regional map of
Great Britain assumes a typical roughness of 0.03 (instead of 0.05). For sites in Great Britain
the roughness should be specified explicitly with a default value of 0.03.
The wind speeds according to ECCS [19], ECCS [20] are up to 25 % higher than those of
ESDU [24]; the difference is assumed to be caused by a inconsequent usage of reference

Thebasicsofthemaparederivedfrom[ 11] /A;someindividualreportsfortendershavebeen
incorporated (Great Belt, Öresund, Göteborg, Helgeland, Höga-Kusten).
Italy, Greece
According to [ 11] . As these are regional maps, the wind speeds will be on the conservative
side, especially for the isles of the Aegis.
Spain, Portugal
Mainly according to ECCS [19], ECCS [20]; for Portugal additional data from [ 12] /A) has
been taken into account.
Eastern Europe
According to ECCS [20] with a transition to the Scandinavian codes in the Baltic region.
Higher Altitudes
For the influence of the altitude ECCS [20] has a factor cALT, defined in the national contribu-
tions to ECCS [20]/A. In general cALT will become greater 1.0 in altitudes from 500 - 800 m.
For example in Germany we have (for altitudes 800 - 1100 m):
c ALT =1.0−1.14 (6.7)
An exception is in Great Britain where we have:
c ALT =1+0.001·h g[m] (6.8)
This last increase has not been taken into account in the map. Thus it is recommended to
account for this effect in Great Britain via the topology.

is selected via the item NORM. For the distribution of the wind you may choose between:
• the literal ATMO (the default), creating a profile based on the atmospheric wind speed,
which may be defined at item ZONE. The 50-year reference value for ATMO may be taken
fromthewindmapinparagraph6.6(Default: 60m/secforZONE).Theprogramgenerates
a theoretical logarithmic profile taking into account the roughness of the terrain based on
the flow models described in [ 8.1, 8.2] .
• one of the listed classical design codes. The program then generates wind profiles con-
forming to those design codes. Although the codes contain only a static wind profile, it is
possible for those standard wind profiles to perform a transient dynamic analysis. The pro-
gram will select the missing parameters (gust speed, turbulence, coherence) automatically
with a reasonable value.
• a reference velocity VB0 or a reference pressure QP0 resp. VP0 with a roughness.
• an explicit profile along the height. The detailed definition is done via the record WPRO.
NORM does not need to be specified in that case, some selected NORM data will be
ignored respectively.
Most design codes have a map and/or a table to let the user select a wind zone or base
mean velocity or a reference peak pressure. Some values have to be adjusted at greater alti-
tudes. Somedesigncodesallowalsoamoredetailedspecificationwithtopologicalformations
(WTOP). Some design codes use an exponential wind profile instead of the logarithmic one.
The second characteristic values to define the velocity over the height is the roughness of the
terrain. Thisisdefinedbyaroughnessheightz0,definableexplicitlyorviaaterraincategories
(CLAS). For changing terrain conditions, a more detailed definition with (WROU) is available.

It has to be noted, that the Eurocode 1991 foresees the definition of the wind profiles within
the national annexes. The national annex is preselected from the global NORM definition, but
may be also appended with a colon at the EN (e.g. EN:NF for France) Thus it is not possible
to elect only EN if the country code does not allow to select the appropriate national annexe.
In any case it is possible to specify only the base wind speed with a value of the ZONE larger
than 10.

The Swiss SIA 261 provides a map of contours of wind pressures at gradient heights.
The Indian design code IS 875 provides a map with basic wind velocities. between 33 and
55 m/sec. The mean velocity and the gust wind speeds are obtained from that value by three
factors k1, k2 and k3. While the coefficient k2 is evaluated by SOFiLOAD, the other two have
to be combined to a value VG0 = Vb·k1·k3 at this record. The specification of the wind zone I
to VI itself is of less importance. However for the categroy the structure class A (d < 20m), B
(20 < d < 50) or C (d > 50m) has to be combined with the terrain category 1 to 4 to a single
input data 1A to 4C. The density of the fluid defaults with that design code to 1.20 kg/m3.
The coordinate values DX, DY, DZ will define the direction of the mean wind in the coordinate
system of the building. The reference point REF and the direction DR are only of relevance
for a dynamic wind history. The define a so called vertical reference plane which should fulfill
the coherence properties to the best degree according to the wishes of the user. More details
to this question are given at record WSPE. For the definition of the above points, all three

GH specifies the height of the terrain in structural coordinates. This is the origin of the so
called wind coordinate system to be used for all input and output. The coordinates of the
heights within the picture 3 created by SOFiLOAD are thus measured not within the structural
system but the wind coordinate system.

The geographical latitude LAT defines via the Coriolis force (Ekmann-Spiral) the height of the

default yields f=0.0001.
HMIN defines the height above ground which contains the constant part of the wind profile.
Below HMIN the profile is extended as constant and no special turbulence properties will be
developed. If the design code does not specify such a value, 10.0 m will be the default.

The wind profile is influenced by the distribution of the roughness of the terrain on the luv side
of the structure, called the roughness profile. A change of the roughness in a distinct distance

TheroughnessprofilemaybespecifiedwiththerecordWROUagainsttheluvsideofthestruc-
ture up to a distance of -200 km. However a maximum of 9 sections with different roughness
are allowed. The input for every section i has a (negative) distance of the start of the section
to the structure and the roughness Ri = within that section. To specify the correct mean value
for the effective roughness an influence width should be taken into account within an aperture
angle of 60◦ respective to the structure.
The roughness value itself is equivalent to the roughness measure in the literature defining an
integration constant for the differential equation of the fluid flow, usually called z0 [ m] , but
with no direct physical meaning. Values taken from the literature for various terrain conditions
are:
Type of terrain z0[m]
broad free water surfaces 0.005
shallow sand areas 0.020
Meadows with hedges and single houses 0.050
(is the effective roughness in Germany) (default)
Suburbans and forests 0.300
Towns with buildings higher than 15 m 1.000
Roughness values larger than 1.0 m can not be treated by SOFiLOAD. The default is a homo-
geneous roughness of z0 = 0.050 m.
The treatment of costal regions via SEA has the following background: the atmospheric wind
is influenced only by the global roughness which is uniform for sea and landside. At a coast
6-18 SOFiSTiK2023WindLoading |SOFiLOAD
like the northern sea there is a rather smooth transition. The wind from the seas side, which
is the only important case will create two boundary layers. The lower one is influenced by the
land, while the upper is governed by the sea. The limit between those layers is increasing in
the height when going to the interior of the landside. The limit will me manifested by a bend in
the wind profile. This point may be within the height of a structure. This special case will be
modelled by defining the SEA and prevent the over estimation of the wind speed.

For wind profiles created from the atmospheric wind or from individual wind profiles, there
are possibilities for geometric elements like hills, edges (sometimes called steps) or ridges in
the vicinity of the structure as well as on the luv as on the lee-side. They influence the wind
speed distribution which is accounted for approximately based on the wind tunnel tests and
evaluations given in Maier-Erbacher [28].
For a hill the epi-centrum is at the top of the hill, for an edge or ridge it might be chosen
arbitrarilyalongthetopline. Thelongitudinalaxisofthehillorthetoplineofanedgeoraridge
is oriented in direction DX,DY,DZ. For an edge it is also important to know about the sign of
the direction. According to the next picture, the foot line of the elevation is always on the right

H is intended as the height at the epi-centrum relative to the base. H may be defined either
as positive or negative. A value H > 0 will raise the wind velocities in general, while a value
H > 0 will smooth the flow such that in the lower part of the boundary layer the mean velocity
will become higher and the turbulence lower. With H < 0 the influence is opposite, but the
favourable effect of this formation is applied only with 50 % on the save side.
The influence of the topology is nonlinear and thus should not be superimposed in general.
To be more precise, the superposition will yield reliable results only if the effect within the plan
view is considerably different, i.e. the dimensions of the elements are considerably different.
Topologyeffectswithmorethan50to60kmextensionsarealreadyincludedintheatmospheric
wind map, the definition of such elements would thus double the effects. Proper definitions do
not contain more than two elements, one of which has an extension of about 10- 30 km, while
the other (rather local) has not more than 1 to 2 km.
Wind definitions according to standard design codes will not allow for such provisions in gen-
eral. An exception is the EC, resp the ’1991’ and ’1055’, but even then only a single edge or
a ridge. Both codes use the same approach which is implemented in SOFiLOAD. Both codes
allow only one single formation and the correction of the wind velocities is in general surely on
the save side. H is allowed only with a positive value if combined with a standard code. An
improper definition (number of elements, type and size of elements etc.) will always yield an
error message.

6.11.1 Spectra
Spectra are defined in the scaled form introduced by Karman along the frequency axis as

where L is the effective wave length defined with the wind profile and thus fm is the effective
frequency of the turbulence. Spectra from Kaimal and Panofsky use for X the Monin coordi-
nates,replacingLbytheheightz. ThespectrafromFichtl/McVehilwillbeusedwithcoefficients
scaled to the Monin-coordinates as well.
The shape of the spectra are different for different directions, therefore the six
coefficients a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, c are defined for three components. There
are other deviations dependent on the author or the type of spectra taken from
the literature. The most important are available and may be selected directly.

The defaults for the longitudinal / lateral / vertical coefficients from type KARM follow the ap-
proachintroducedbyKarman,whichdescribestherealityinthebestwayaccordingtocommon
practice. A deviation from that should be made only in special cases. A second common ap-
proach is the Eurocode-Spectra (part 2-4 Appendix B.11, Type CEN), a simplified form of the
Karman spectra to become more important with the application of Eurocodes. There are two
classical spectra available, the spectra from Davenport (DAVE), which is very popular in the
above form in Germany and Central Europe. Dave is not mathematical correct in its asymp-
totic behaviour, and has been corrected therefore multiple times, however it is mostly used in
its original form. DAVE describes as well as EC or the Harris (HARR) spectra only the longi-
tudinal component. The missing two other directions are calculated with the Karman formulas
therefore. DAVE and HARR use a simplified scaling with small deviations from the Karman
approach.
An other possible choice are the formulas published by Fichtl/McVehil (NASA TN D 5584,

To compare the different formulas, the next picture shows the longitudinal components of the

Any spectrum including the individual defined spectra have to fulfill as all other implemented
spectra the normalization condition:
(cid:90) ∞ S(ƒ)dƒ
Ψ= =1.0 (6.16)
ƒ
0
SOFiLOAD will check for any use of WGEN the normalization in the highest and lowest point
of the structure and will flag any deviation with more than +/- 5% for Ψ. In those cases the
simplest remedy is to scale the coefficients a1, a2, a3 within a new definition of WSPE by 1/Ψ.
For larger deviations a check of the function definition is strongly recommended.
6.11.2 Coherence
The coherence function implemented in SOFiLOAD are according ESDU 86010 (ESDU [25],
chapter 7, appendix A2).

(cid:112) coherence=γ (Δr)=exp(cid:128) −0.65η1 1.3(cid:138) (6.19)
These ESDU functions are a good approximation to the function given by Karman analytically.
The matrix of coherence defines an isotropic coherence, which is distorted however near the
surface due to roughness effects (ESDU [25]). The function is corrected near the surface
automaticallyanddoesnotneedtobecorrectedforthatcase. Onlythesefunctionsareallowed
for the generation of a transient wind field.
However, for a spectral analysis all types of coherence function may be used. The most com-
mon formula is that of Davenport from 1962:
ƒ
γ k ≈ep(−C·r· ) (6.20)
V
A general conversion of the coefficients of these functions is not possible. For the Davenport
formulation care should be taken, as there are also coefficients in use which are defined for
γ2
the coherence itself. These coefficients are larger by a factor of 2.
k
A better approach are the modified exponential functions of Krenk Dyrbye and Hansen [16],
which account for negative coherence as well as for the decay of the coherence for zero fre-
quencies for larger separation distances. A comparison can be done with the record WTST.

n  =(cid:116)n2+ (6.23)
2πL
The coherence γ(η) will thus be controlled via the half value distance factor η 1, thus the dis-
tance where the square root γ of the coherence diminishes by a factor of 2. This factors η 1
have to be defined for the coherence factor k k. For high frequencies and large heights we
have:

with:
 first Index ,, = Turbulence component
k second Index ,, = Separation direction (axis along which the coherence is
checked)
If for example in picture A2 of the ESDU for the root of coherence γ  = 0.5 a value η = 0.7
is taken. Then an approximate value of k  = 0.7/(2π) = 0.11 is obtained. The default of
the elements of the Kj -Matrix is slightly conservative taking into account measurements of
the last 30 years. It is possible to change single elements individually. The values define a
homogenouscoherencewhichisstretchedatthesurfacedependingontheroughness.(ESDU
[25]) The values thus are larger than the original values from Davenport.

Based on the wind profile and parameters including, turbulence and integral length distribu-
tions, defined with the basic load case LFG a number of load cases will be generated with
random transient wind loading.
The random properties are assured by the load case number, which is also used as the ini-
tialization value for the random sequence. The required number of wind histories has to be
derived from the safety concept of the building. For the common design codes and safety
6-30 SOFiSTiK2023WindLoading |SOFiLOAD
factors for wind a number of 11 histories should be adequate in most cases.
The wind definition thus starts with the basic wind load case, e.g..
LC 300 W TITL 'Wind basic load case'
WIND DY 1 XREF 0 0 0 DXR 0.1 1.0 GH 5.0
WROU 0.02 ; WPRO H 100 VBOE 65 ; WTOP ...
WSPE EN:DIN
For a spectral analysis the options TLON, TLAT and TVER create the quasi-static loading
based on the turbulence intensity. If the base case has been analyzed, the obtained mean
rotations of the sections will be accounted for. The background response may be specified
with PSI0 at the load case.
Selecting components with SPEC, the generation of the individual spectra and wind histories
ist triggered. As this is somehow time consuming, it is highly recommended to check first the
baseloadcasethoroughlyinalldetails. Withtheabovedefinedbaseloadcase300wehave:

create the discrete wind history via a discrete Fourier-transformation. The spectra generated

V-Z, CFD-Boundary conditions with types U, V and W.
Some parameters of wind generation (e.g. DT, FMAX, FDEL) may be selected by the user,
they have to match however. The frequency step FDEL has to be small enough, otherwise
a non natural periodicity of the wind load may be obtained. DT has to be chosen in such a
way that all important frequencies of the structure are properly addressed. An optional value
of FMAX has then to be larger that those important structural resonance frequencies. For the
case of a steady wind it is possible to specify DT 0.0 as special case.
The wind generation will become very costly on the other side if the parameters are chosen
to generous, thus it might be necessary to choose a best compromise. FMAX and FDEL may
be also changed for tests or prechecks in the evaluation phase of a project to have shorter
response times. For the final design however, the parameters should match the statistic nec-
essaries. Thedefaultsareselectedbasedontheneedsforlargebridges. forsmallerstructures
SOFiSTiK2023 6-31SOFiLOAD|WindLoading
modifications are necessary, e.g. reducing the value of DT, enlarging the value of FMAX.
Within the generation of turbulence a decay of turbulence for the end point of an element
basedonthelocaldecayofcoherencyalongthebeamaxisisimplementedallowinganeasier
generation of beam loading. For checks of the turbulence it might be requested to switch this
option off via the definition of LCOH OFF.
It is also recommended to start with a primary load case based on the static wind to keep the
disturbances of the start up period as low as possible. The best start is to use the same wind
field of the mean wind directly as a static load case for this purpose.
For the static wind generation the wind velocities will be converted to classical loadings, which
can be used in other programs as well. If the literal MEAN or GUST has an appendix ":E"
the loads will be generated separately, thus the transverse loading is acting with a possible
eccentricity in the WPAR referenece point.
The volume of the data may become rather large, because a nonlinear history will create an
own load case for every time step. That is why we recommend to use a separate copy of the
database for every history. With the definition of the TO item, a clone of the current database
is created containing all necessary data for the wind history analysis. After performing the
analysis and all superpositions, the extreme values may be imported into the master via the
program DBMERG.

Using a wind tunnel experiment a model of the building is tested yielding integral forces or
pressures in discrete points. They vary along time and it is depending on the structure if the

To convert those pressures to loadings the recommended procedure is as follows:
• For every measured data item a separate load case is defined.
• Then a unit pressure of 1.0 is applied in that data point while all other data points have the
valueof0.0. Thisyieldsaarealdistributionofpressuretobetakenasinfluencefunctionof

7.2 Introduction
Oceanic waters are deep waters, such that the waves are unaffected by the seabed, with-
out currents or obstacles such as islands, headlands and breakwaters. In contrast with the
treatment of coastal waters, a limited but constant water depth, i.e. a horizontal bottom, is
considered [29].
Waves on the surface of the ocean, with periods usually between 3 to 25 sec, are a funda-
mental feature of coastal regions. Other wave motions exist on the ocean including internal
SOFiSTiK2023 7-1SOFiLOAD|WaveLoading
waves,currents,tides,andedgewaves. Thetermwaveswillhereapplyonlytosurfacegravity
waves, to water with idealized physical properties and motions and with gravitation as the only
external force [30].
Knowledge of these waves and the forces they generate is essential for the design of offshore
structures. Anoverviewofthetheoriesandmathematicalformulasfordescribingoceansurface
waves and the forces, accelerations, and velocities due to them, is given here, and two main
wave categories are treated: regular waves and irregular waves.
In the Regular Waves section, the objective is to provide a detailed understanding of the kine-
matics of a wave field through examination of waves of constant height and period. In the
IrregularWavessection,theobjectiveistodescribethemethodsinvolvedforanalyzingirregu-
lar waves which are more descriptive of the waves seen in nature.
7.3 Regular Waves
Wave theories are approximations to reality. When looking at the sea surface, it is typically
irregular, three-dimensional and changes in time. The complexity of this time-varying 3− D
surface cannot be adequately described in its whole, and thus simplifying assumptions must
be employed in order to arrive at estimates able to represent it.
The simplest mathematical representation of oceanic waves is provided by the linear wave
theory. Linear theory is described by freely propagating, small in amplitude, harmonic waves.
The main requirement for the linear theory to apply is that the amplitudes of the waves are
small, i.e. small compared with the wave length and small compared to the water depth. This
linear theory is also called Airy and can cover many engineering problems with reasonable
accuracy.
Whenwaveheightsbecomelarger,thelineartheorymaynotbeadequateandfiniteamplitude
wave theories have to be used. These theories are nonlinear and allow formulation of waves
thatarenotpurelysinusoidalinshape. Forsteepwavesorwavesinshallowwater,e.g. waves
with flatter troughs and peaked crests, higher order theories will be described such as the
Stokes wave theory and the Cnoidal wave theory. Furthermore, the stretching of linear theory
is introduced, which compensates for the small amplitude assumption and maps the results
into the finite region of their extent.

where k is the wave number k = 2π/L, L the wavelength, ω the circular frequency ω = 2π/T
and T the period. The wave speed (celerity) c is defined as c=L/T.
The particle velocities can readily be obtained from the velocity potential as ϑϕ/ϑ =   and
ϑϕ/ϑz =  z and the accelerations as the time derivative of the velocities ϑ /ϑt =   and

7.3.2 Stokes 2nd and 5th Order Wave Theory
Inthelinearwavetheory,awavewithaharmonicsurfaceprofilethatconformstothelinearised
basic equations and boundary conditions is described. It only approximates though the non-
linear equations and boundary conditions. A better approximation can be found by adding
corrections to the harmonic wave profile. This is done by the Stokes theory by adding ex-
tra harmonic waves to the basic harmonic, in terms of a successive correction, where every
higher-order correction is obtained on the basis of the previously obtained lower-order correc-
tion. The order of the theory is the number of terms considered. For example, the surface
elevation for Stokes 2nd order, consisting of two terms, is given by [29]:

Many advancements have been made since the initial theory and the cnoidal wave theory
presented byFenton [34] (1990), [35] (1999) is included here, both the full 3rd order as well as
the 5th order Iwagaki approximation.
In Fenton [35] (1999) the underlying method relies on the expansion in two main parameters:

sion for C2, the factor +2592 should be replaced by −2592, see Nishimura & al. (1977), Fenton [32] (1985),

For the Cnoidal 5th order Iwagaki approximation a simplification is assumed, suggested by
the fact that for waves which are not low and/or short, the values of the parameter m used in
practiceareveryclosetounityindeed. Thissuggeststhesimplificationthat,inalltheformulae,

This theory takes its name by its originator Iwagaki (1968). Here, the Fenton [35] (1999)
approach is implemented, which suggests that wherever m appears explicitly as a coefficient,
not as an argument of an elliptic integral or function, it is replaced by 1, but is retained in all
elliptic integrals and functions.

7.3.4 Stretching
AIRY-Theory is only defined up to the SWL and for waves of infinitesimal small height. How-
ever, when extended to finite crest amplitudes the results above the SWL are overestimated
[36], [37]. To remedy this, either the values are extrapolated or the results are stretched (or
7-6 SOFiSTiK2023WaveLoading |SOFiLOAD
compressed) to the actual water level.

Extrapolation
Four different extrapolation or stretching schemes are implemented here, in order to provide a
more realistic representation of the near surface fluid kinematics for linear waves and random
waves consisting of linear waves:
• Wheeler Stretching: the profile of the fluid kinematics computed by the linear theory is
effectivelystretchedorcompressedtotheinstantaneouswavesurface. Thisisachievedby
replacing z with z(cid:48) =d d+z −d in Eq. 7.11.
d+η
• Chakrabarti Stretching
• VerticalStretching: forfluidparticleslocatedabovetheSWL,thevaluesaretakenequalto
those obtained at z=0, hence are stretched vertically.
• Linear Extrapolation
Hint
The stretching is a filtering technique, which modifies the small-amplitude assumption
of linear Airy wave theory. Its use is important for the irregular waves, since they are
composedbysuperposinglinearAirywaves. Withthislinearfilteringmethod,awavetrain
of any length and any degree of irregularity can be used in design of offshore structures.
Stretching is applicable to finite water. This means that when the full range of irregular
waves (T mn - T m) is evaluated, the stretching scheme will only be applied for those
regular waves that will fall into finite water.
7.3.5 Validity of Wave Theories
The simplest linear wave theory from Airy is based on the assumption of small wave heights.
When the waves become steeper nonlinear theories have to be used like Stokes 3rd of 5th
order or the cnoidal wave theory. But above a certain wave height the waves will break and
a consistent description is only possible with extended methods like particle or CFD models.
The limits of the different theories may be seen in Fig. 7.3 Holthuijsen [29]:

Figure7.3: Wavemodels
Wave height is limited by both depth and wavelength. For a given water depth and wave
period, there is a maximum height limit above which the wave becomes unstable and breaks.
This upper limit of wave height, called breaking wave height, is in deep water a function of the
wavelength. In shallow and transitional water it is a function of both depth and wavelength.
Wave breaking is a complex phenomenon and it is one of the areas in wave mechanics that
has been investigated extensively both experimentally and numerically.
The range over which periodic solutions for waves can occur is given in Figure 7.4, which
shows limits to the existence of waves determined by computational studies. The highest
waves possible, H=H m, are shown by the thick line, which is the approximation to the results
7-8 SOFiSTiK2023WaveLoading |SOFiLOAD
of Williams (1981), presented as Equation 7.17 in Fenton [34] (1990):

d d d
Nelson has shown from experiments, that the maximum wave height achievable (just below
breaking) in practice is actually only H m/d = 0.55, rather than 0.78 which is the theoretical
maximum. According to Nelson [38] (1994), the difference between ratios of H/d 0.78 to 0.55
mayleadtoasignificantreductioninthewaveloadingsandthedesigncrestlevelsabovemean
water level.
The degree of nonlinearity of waves is often quantified with the Ursell number U, which com-
bines wave steepness S=H/L and relative water depth:
steepness (H/L) HL2
U= = = (7.18)
(rete depth)3 (d/L)3 d3
It has been pointed out that the Cnoidal theory should be applied for U > 40, marking the
boundary between Stokes and Cnoidal theory, as shown in Fig. 7.4. Furthermore, it is neces-
sarytoknowthelimitingvalueofwaveheightsandwavesteepnessatdifferentwaterdepthsto
establish range of validity of a Stokes-type expansion. This is customarily done by comparing
the magnitude of each successive term in the expansion [30]. Each should be smaller than
the term preceding it. For example, if the third-order term is to be less than 1 percent of the
second-order term, the limiting wave steepness is H/L=(1/7) sinh3(kd) (cid:113) 1+8 cosh3(kd).

tions stated before. A complete modeling of all effects requires considerable numerical effort
for a fluid structure interaction with field methods (CFD).
7.4 Irregular Waves
A more realistic description of the waves has to account for different directions and periods
of the waves. If a restriction to the linear wave theory is accepted, it becomes possible to
use statistical methods with a wave spectra. Then the moving surface elevation η(t) can be
described as a sum of NF harmonic waves, each with a constant amplitude A  and a phase φ 
randomly chosen [29].

In JONSWAP, the scatter in the values of the shape parameters γ, σ  and σ b was so large
that average values were determined and are usually applied. Two values for the standard
deviation σ  = 0.07 and σ b = 0.09 are used here: the first for ω < ω pek, while the second
for ω≥ω pek. Forthepeakenhancementcoefficient γ,theaveragevalueof 3.3 isusedhere,
and is limited with a lower bound of γ≥1.0. The energy scale parameter α is here expressed
in terms of the peak period as α=0.0317(1/T pek)0.67. An average value commonly used is
also α =0.0081. For γ=1.0, JONSWAP falls into the special case of the Pierson-Moskowitz
spectrum, which is used to describe fully developed seas.

Instead of the single design wave a complete spectra of an irregular wave field may be used.
In that case H is the siginficant wave height, while T is the peak period of the spectra. The
seed for the random generator is the load case number. Values of NF, TMIN, TMAX etc. are
used only for that case.
Furthermore, the irrational frequency, rather than the default constant frequency interval, can
be applied for the calculation of the amplitudes, when using a spectrum. This is done by
specifying the literal :I after the input spectra type, e.g. JONS:I or with a stretching scheme
JONS:IW.
For the TMA spectrum, the default values used here for the parameters γ and α are given
by Eq. 7.23, as described by Hughes [40]. The main advantage of this parameterization is
the ability to specify the equilibrium wind sea spectrum associated with a given energy level.
Otherwise a standard input could be given as in JONSWAP spectra, such as for example
γ = 3.3 and α = 0.0081, which will just transform the corresponding JONSWAP to a shallow
water spectrum.
Thewavekinematicsmaybeenhancedbyaconstantcurrent. Forthisanexponentialdistribu-
