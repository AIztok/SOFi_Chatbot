1 General
With the Construction Stage Manager, shortly called CSM, construction stages and creep
analysis problems can be defined and controlled in an easy way.
The CSM program produces an input file for the common SOFiSTiK programs ASE and
AQB that finally do the analysis. The program does not require further licences. For ASE at
lease ASE1 is needed, for creep analysis in AQB, AQBS is needed.

2 Theoretical Background
2.1 General
With the CSM (Construction Stage Manager) a construction sequence can be defined and
analyzed.
The construction stages are controlled with the following tables:
- the table CS defines the used construction stages
- the group table GRP defines, when a group is activated
- the load case table LC defines additional loads (g_2)
TendonsareautomaticallyactivatedstartingfromtheICS1numberdefinedinTENDON.From
ICS2 on they are bonded.
WithafewinputtovariableactionsthenanautomaticdesigncanbestartedwithCSMDESI.
2.2 Activation of new elements
MaintaskoftheCSMisthesimulationofaconstructionsequence. Amainpartistheactivation
of a new element.
Lets consider a multispan girder where we start with erection and loading of span 1. The
cantilever nose gets a vertical deformation. In the following, span 2 shall be activated and this
leads to the problem how to position the formwork. For this we have three possibilities, see
CTRL CANT ??:
Figure2.1: CTRLCANT-activationofanewgroup
We choose CTRL CANT 1 and place the formwork horizontally at the cantilever nose. Four
important actions or situations follow:
- 1. the formwork is placed. This does not create a new load as the formwork stands on the
ground, see following figure.
- 2. the concrete is filled in. This also does not create a new load as the concrete load goes
directly over the formwork in the ground.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-1CSM|TheoreticalBackground
- 3. concrete hardens. This also does not create a new load as the concrete only goes from
state liquid to a stressfree hardened state.
- 4. the formwork is removed. Now the dead load of the concrete loads out structure.
The following figure shows situation 1+2+3 on top and situation 4 on bottom:
Figure2.2: Activationofanewgroup,formworkstandsonground

In case you do not want to precamber your segments BUT you want to add (weld) them tan-
gentially (CTRL CANT 2) AND you want to have the beams placed on the supports in the
architectural position:

freewithoutdeadload’(’stressfreewithoutdeadload’meansthatthesegmentstillhangsonthe

crane in this stage),
2.3 Numbering
A very concise calculation can be done, if the numbering of groups, construction stages and
prestressing stages match together in ascending order with respect to time.
Due to the fact that intermediate construction steps (e.g.: prestressing, grouting, moving of
temporary loads, creep..) are carried out between two main construction stages (CS) it is
useful to store these main stages in every 10th construction stage number. So there are
enough numbers in between to stor re the intermediate steps properly without shifting the
numbers of the main stages, even if the intermediate steps are inserted subsequently.
Proposed Numeration:
- 10th : Activation of a new group
- 11th : Prestressing
- 12th : Grouting / extrusion
- 13th : Loads of construction stages (e.g.: cantilever carriage..)
- 15th : Creep-step
For example: Group 50 is activated in construction stage 50 (hardening of concrete in CS 50)
thenthecorrespondingtendonisprestressedinCS51andgrouted/extrudedinCS52.Hence
the tendon has to be defined in TENDON...CS with ICS1=51 and ICS2=52.
2.4 Construction Stages to be Computed
All construction stages that cause changes of stresses have to be considered. Therefore
construction stage grouting / extrusion (CS: x2) is not necessarily to be computed, due to the
fact that the grouting mortar causes no changes in stresses.
Thechangeofasupport-conditiondoesnotintroducenewloadsbutleadstodeformationsand
resulting stresses and has to be taken into account as a load case in an own stage.
2.5 Load Cases - Primary Load Cases - Difference Load Cases
A list over the loadcases used by CSM is printed at the end of this chapter.
The TYPE (LC TYPE) of a loadcase has no longer an effect. Importand is the TYPE in CS.
Theloadcasesofadditionalloadsshouldbeadvantageouslydefinedwiththesameloadcase-
andconstructionstagenumber,e.g.: Loadcase43: loadsofcantilevercarriageforconstruction
stage 43.
Initially the calculation is performed with the complete loading resulting in complete internal
forces for the end of the computed construction stage. This is necessary, because with a
change of the support conditions the complete active support-force has to be shifted accord-
ingly. HenceASEistakingallloadsactivatedforthisconstructionstageintoaccount. Theload
case numbers of these complete load cases are stored within the 4000 numbers, e.g. CS 40
with all loads in load case 4040.
For the further design with AQB only the difference in internal forces between the load cases
is required, AQB for instance has to consider different safety-factors for design at the ultimate
SOFiSTiK2023 2-3CSM|TheoreticalBackground
limit state. Thus, in addition to the internal forces of the complete load case, the difference in
internalforcesreferingtothelastloadcaseisstoredaswellwithinthe5000numbers(e.g.: CS
40 in load case 5040). Load case 5040 stores the difference in internal forces between load
case 4040 and 4035 (assuming load case 4035 is the construction stage before 4040).
LoadcaseswithcreeparestoredbyAQBwithinthe6000loadcasesandcontainthechangeof
internal forces due to creep and shrinkage of the cross-section, the corresponding load cases
with numbers 5000 of the creep analysis with ASE only store the internal forces due to the
redistribution of forces caused by creep and shrinkage.

Lets assume a prestressed beam on creep acting loading G+P:
Inafirststep,anAQBrunchecksthepuresectioncreeponconstantbendingmoment. Dueto
creep, shrinkage and tendon steel relaxation the tendon stress will decrease by ΔσP, parallel
the concrete stress will change to hold the constant outer bending moment.

in LC 6000... (on constand outer bending moment). The LC 6000... only gets a printed delta
moment, because usually the engineer wants to see the part without the statically prestress.

2.6 Analysis of Creep and Shrinkage
FromtheeffectivewidthoftheelementsseeAQUA(forquadelementsthe1.4timesquadthick-
ness is taken due to a considered covering on top), the CSM calculates creep and shrinkage
values in dependence of T0 and TS, the creep duration, the temperature and the air humidity.
The CSM uses code based functiions that are also used in AQB.

2.6.1 Loading start T0 and shrinkage start TS
For shrinkage an age TS of 3 days is set by default, With the input GRP...TS this can be
changed in CSM. We assume/calculate that physically shrinkage starts at this age TS. The
analysis creep and shrinkage intervals start at T0 (loading age). So in the first creep and
shrinkage interval T0 to T0+T the shrinkage part from TS to T0 is not applied! This is correct
for the standard case prestress with subsequent bond where prestress C+S loss starts at T0.
With the same reason also the total shrinkage value does not include this first shrinkage part
from TS to T0!
In steel composite sections it is necessary to take into account the first shrinkage part from
TS up to the start of loading. To do this you must input T0=TS= 1 day, see example
steel_composite_orto.dat .
For in situ concrete slab on a prerefabricated beam T0 may not be input too small because
thentheconcretewounldbetooweakforfirstdeadloadG_1orprestressing. Thusinexample
csm3_composite_beam.dat T0=3 andTS=1 is set for group 10. Completely correct could also
be to input T0=TS= 1 day, calculate the first activation of the beams without dead load (GRP
FACD), then add a creep step with e.g. 7 days and then activate dead load G_1 and following
prestress P.
2.6.2 Real Creep
The behavior of function CTRL CREP RCRE (real creep) can be best demonstrated on a
simple one span girder with a temporary load -> real_creep_creepparameter.dat.
A girder will be stripped after t0=7 days. To keepn it simple dead load is switched off (or you
imaginetheloadtobehorizontally). Afterfurther93daysaloadingAoccurs. Afterfurther200
days the load is taken away again:
- t0 = 7 days : Stripping construction stage CS 10
- t1=100 days : Start loading load A construction stage CS 20
- t2=300 days : End of load construction stage CS 30
- t∞ =30 years : final stage

load A


t0 t1 t2 t∞
From t2 up to t∞ the girder is stressfree and one could imagine that no further deformation
occurs. But this is not the case, the ist deformation goes back further. This bahavior is also
called back-creeping or in the CSM notation "real creep" with CTRL CREP RCRE.
The CSM bzw. ASE and AQB treat the load A in two parts, one loading starting at t1 und
one negative loading starting at t2. This is analyzed in the two difference loadcases 5020 and
5030:
difference loadcase 5020
{ 0.89 {
1.04
t0 t1 t2 t∞
{
1.88
t0 t1
difference case 5030
- difference loadcas 5020 starts at time t1 with an own creep function (red). T0 of this creep
function is 100 days.
- difference loadcas 5030 starts at time t2 with an own creep function (red). T0 of this creep
function is 300 days.
2-10 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
As the two creep parts have own time shifted delayed elastic parts, the backward creeping
occurs.
In example real_creep_creepparameter.dat we get the following output (first CSM run):

In creep stage 25 from t1 up to t2 the system creeps under load with a delta-phi of 0.61 (last
but one line RCRE für t0=100). In creep stage 35 from t2 up to t∞ the positive load part 5020
creeps with a delta-phi of 0.43, the negative load part 5020 (t0=300) creeps with 0.83. This
results in the backward creeping.
For an exact creep analysis on time varying loading CTRL CREP RCRE should be used be-
cause only then a later load part will get an own creep function.

Group 2 is not yet active in creep step CS 15, therefore the starting delta-phi of 0.63 appears
in CS 25 for the first time. Creep for the older Group 1 is calculated with a delta-phi of 0.14 in
this stage. But the total creep factor 1.91 is the same for all groups.
Shrinkage coefficients are computed accordingly.
Now to compare: the same example with CTRL CREP RCRE:

We see that the first line is the same as in the table before but load parts acting later get an
own T0 and an own creep function with an own total phi value.
Thus for a normal analysis the default CTRL CREP RCRE should be used.
2.6.4 Manipulation of creep and shrinkage values
In case of real creep via AQB the individual creep values are always calculated in AQB. So
they cannot be manipulated via CSM. Then the input CREP...PHI and DEPS...DPHI can not
be used. Furthermore AQB calcualtes the values depending on the actual effective member
thickness of each beam. CSM makes this only with an average effective member thicknesss
within a group.
Please notice that you can define different degrees of air contact for every edge of a cross
section in AQUA to adjust the analysis of the effective member thickness (compare to
csm3_composite_beam.dat AQUA...VERT...EXP).
Also the shinkage values are calculaed in AQB depending on the actual thickness. Only if you
input final shrinkage values in CREP...EPS or delta values in DEPS...DEPS. Then CSM would
passthemanipulatedshrinkagevaluestoAQB.AQBwouldtakethesevaluesbutthenignoring
a possible individual effective member thickness e.g. in haunches.
SoitisbettertochangematerialparameterinAQUAtoadjustcreepandshrinkage. Thenboth
CSM and AQB can use them.
For concrete you can input more parameter for creep and shrinkage in AQUA MEXT EIGE
according EN 1992-1. See example real_creep_creepparameter.dat.
Often only the final creep or shrinkage value shall be adjusted. Then you can just use the
following major parameter:
- MEXT ... VAL1 = value beta-bc1 = factor on final creep value
- MEXT ... VAL3 = value beta-cd1 = factor on drying shrinkage
- MEXT ... VAL5 = value beta-ca1 = factor on chemical shrinkage
e.g. for 1.2 times creep and 1.4 times shrinkage:
CONC 1 C 40 ; MEXT 1 TYPE EIGE VAL1 1.20 VAL3 1.40 VAL5 1.40
2-12 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
A compare of possibilities to modify creep curves and a recommendation is also shown at the
end of example file explicit_creep_curve.dat.
In simple cases you can also just adjust the temperature or the humidity.
2.6.5 Systems Consisting of Beams with AQB
Prestressed beams and composite cross sections require the analysis of creep and shrinkage
via AQB due to the fact that only AQB differentiates the internal stresses of a cross section.
BeamswithoutprestressorbondcanbecomputedwithASEdirectlywithoutAQB.Prestressed
slabs can be computed as well using CSM+ASE without AQB.
2.6.6 Creep and Shrinkage of quad- and bric- and truss elements
QUAD,BRICandTrusselementscanbecomputedwithASEdirectlywithoutAQB.Prestressed
slabs can be computed as well using the CSM.
ForQUADelementstheeffectivememberthicknesscanbeenteredwithCREP...DEFQ.With-
out any input for the effective thickness CSM computes an averaged value over all QUAD
elements of one group and multiplies this thickness with 1.4 to get the effective member thick-
ness.
For BRIC elements the effective member thickness must be input in CREP...DEFQ for the
BRIC groups.
2.6.7 Creep of other elements
Springs,elasticboundaries,quadbedding,FLEX-andHASE-halfspaceelementsdonothave
a concrete material number and are treated separate.
Please notice: in case spring elements represent concrete elements, e.g. an abutment, they
shouldcreepaswell. Otherwisespuriousrestraintscanoccur. E.g. asinglespangirderisfixed
with rotations springs right and left, the restraint moment will increase if only the girder creeps
andthespringsnot. Butthisisnotthecaseifallismaseofconcreteandcreepssimultanious.
Only in case the springs are really made of steel and do not creep this can be input with CSM
GRP PHIF 0.
Elastic boundaries, quad bedding, FLEX- and HASE- halfspace elements often represent soil.
But soil also creates long term deflections what is similar to creep. CSM+ASE can simulate
these long term deflections by using a concrete creep behavior also for these elements.
- Springs have a group number and react on GRP-PHIF. They use the creep curves of a
concrete beam or quad in the same group. If this does not exist, ASE uses the creep
curves of a reference element - see below.
- QuadbeddingshaveagroupnumberandreactonGRP-PHIF.Asthequad-materialisused
for the quad concrete, the bedding uses a creep curve of a reference element - see below.
- Elastic boundaries (BOUN) and FLEX elements use the group number for GRP-PHIF and
PHIP-PHIonlyincaseofCTRLCREPSTAN.Intherealcreep(RCRE)howeverGRP-PHIF
istakenfromgroup0,PHIP-PHIcannotbeused,thecreepfunctionofareferenceelement
is used - see below.
- HASE halfspace elements always use the reference element.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-13CSM|TheoreticalBackground
- Pile element with a bore profile bedding however use the concrete creep value also for the
bedding!
If a reference element is needed you best define a dummy concrete element in group
0. That material will then be used for the creep curves of these elements, see example
hase3_hase3_variable_surface_level.dat. In case in group 0 no element is found ASE takes
the first concrete element (beam or quad).
In the real creep (RCRE) in GRP 0 PHIF only the input 1 and 0 is allowed for creep YES and
NO. Best input GRP-PHIF with the same value for all groups.
2.6.8 Temperature Effects
Without input, CSM works on 20 degree celsius. Via CS...TEMP for each creep step an in-
dividual temperature can be definied. The effective age on first loading in GRP...T0 is always
related to 20 degrees!
In case of a heat treatment we recommend to not calculate the heat treatment in CSM directly
but to start with the analysis at the time when the tendons are cut in the factory. So we
recommend to not input a higher temperature but to stretch the time in the heat treatment
manually and to insert a higher value for T0 (first loading), e.g.
- for a first heat treatment on 2 days with 50 degree (dt-eff=2*3.547 = 7.094d)
you must input T0=7.1 days.
The above used factor 3.547 is analyzed using EN 1992-1-1 annex C equation (B.10).
As the tendon usually also expands due to the heat treatment, the effective prestress is lower
according EN 1992-1-1 10.5.2. So in TENDON a prestress reduced by the temperature dif-
ference must be input! See example csm3_casting_bed_method.dat comments after PROG
CSM.
2.6.9 Further Comments to Creep and Shrinkage
Whenevertwoquadgroupswithdifferentelementthicknessmeettogether,thedifferentphiand
eps values will result in additional stresses! This schould be considered in the arrangement
of the groups or via the manual input of an average effective member thickness. On problem
temperature on quad superstructure see also example temp_load_tbeam.dat.
Weak concrete E modulus of young concrete is already included in the creep values.
2.7 Comparison with Cast-in-one System
With CTRL CAST 1 the following load cases are computed for the means of a comparison:
Load cases for cast-in-one system (with the last group setting!)
- 3991 G_1 cast-in-one system
- 3992 G_2 cast-in-one system
- 3993 P cast-in-one system
2-14 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
- 3994 C one step without exact redistributions due to creep (AQB - ctrl eige 4)
2.8 Check-Print and Control-plots of the Calculation
For beam structures a printout of internal forces and stresses for a certain cut is also gen-
erated automatically. This tabular AQB output should be checked in any case especially for
prestressed structures. The results can be found in the report file (NAME_csm.plb) in chapter
”Considered Section BEAM...”.
After the tabular AQB output mentioned above, a plot of the overall stresses of all construction
stages is generated. These results are stored in AQB with COMB...LCST in the load cases
6000 and following, these results are only stored in the Database for this very beam section.
You can also enforce a separate Check-Print and Controll-Plot, see ’Check print construction
stages for another beam’ in csm31_design.dat.
IfthesestressesshouldbecomputedandstoredforallbeamsectionsCTRLSTOR+1canbe

2.9.1 Principle of linear precamber
The following figure shall show the principle. Lets assume a single span girder. In a first
straight forward analysis we start on a straight formwork. After g_1 and g_2 and creep until
traffic opening we get a deformation downwards.
If we mirror this shape and use it as predeformation for the formwork, we will end up in a
straight shape on traffic opening:

Important awareness: the forces are the same, only the deformations look different.
2.9.2 Workflow in CSM
With changing groups in the construction stages the task is a little bit more compli-
cate but the same in principle. The following description is based on the example

2.9.3 First Construction Stage analysis
Construction sequence: span by span erection - always concreting in a formwork standing on
the ground. So the stiffness is activated in advance without dead load and stressfree (first
liquid concrete).
In the following step the dead load is activated = removal of formwork.
General use:
Inaprecamberanalysisitisusefultofirstactivateelementswithoutdeadloadtogettheheight
levels for the formwork (or the stressfree fabrication form).
For this the input GRP ICSD allows a later activation of dead load for a group.
Please first activate a group in GRP ICS1 without dead load
(dead load still hanging on the crane or lying in a formwork on the ground)
Then activate dead load in the next stage (remove from crane or remove formwork)

2.9.4 Perform precamber
Now all deformations are availabe and CSM can perform the necessary precamber.
If we look top the first construction block it is clear that his deformation just has to be mirrored
and applied as negative precamber to achieve a zero displacement on trafic opening. In the
same way the CSM corrects all other deformations and stores the displacements new. The
loadcases 4000... then contain the modified total deformations, for checks the results of the
first analysis are stored without modification in the loadcases 14000.... The results in the
4000... loadcases for CAMB 35 are as follows:

2.9.5 Main conclusion for linear precamber
A linear precamber does not change the forces in a linear analysis! Only the deformations are
modified!
This means in parallel, that in a force optimization you must never care about the displace-
ments. The displacements can always be adjusted in a simple (cheap) linear percamber!
Except: TH3 analysis. Or in other words: Much more important is a force finding than a dis-
placement target if you do construction stage optimization! .

2.9.6 Nonlinear precamber analysis
Especially on cable stayed structures a precamber has an effect on the analysis because a
change in the cable length has en effect on the cable sagging.
Incaseyoucalculateyourerectionwithconstructionstages,thewholeanalysismustbererun
including the precamber to alalyze with correct new cable length. If a new segment is added,
it must be added with the shop form that includes the necessary precamber calculated in the
last iteration run.
Best start with example csm29_precamber_nonl.dat. After the analsis please open animator
with LC 4009. You will see the stressfree shop form of the first segment. Info: this loadcase
was analyzed without deadload and so has no stresses. The precamber you see has been
calculated at the end of the last EQIT iteration:
Figure2.5: StressfreeshopformfirstsegmentLC4009
Then best set magnitude of displacement to factor 20 and klick further to loadcase 4030. The
cable sagging informs you that you see the result of a nonlinear ASE analysis. The beam
is straight (traffic opening) - that just was the target of the nonlinear precamber analysis, re-
quested with CAMB 30 mode EQIT:
Figure2.6: LC4030: straightsuperstructuretrafficopeningincludingcablesagging
Looking to loadcase 4019 you see the shop form of the second segment - this has been
activated without dead load with it’s shop form:

For this please open file csm29_precamber_plot.dat and look to the result of this CAMB mode
ANI run:
Figure2.8: Allsegmentschainedupstressfreewiththeirshopform
You can also use this funktion CAMB mode ANI if you activate your segments in their first
activation with dead load! The CAMB mode ANI will also then join together all segments with
their shop form.
Now we go to example csm30_a_precamber_on_site_adjustment.dat
As before we get the target of a well balanced bending moment distribu-
tion and the precamber with a mixed EQIT and CAMB analysis (last plot in
csm30_a_precamber_on_site_adjustment.dat):
Figure2.9: Cablestayedbridgewithtargetfunction-550kNmbendinginsuperstructure

and the necessary total precamber of the superstructure after a CAMB mode ANI run (plot in

metric settlement and inclines to the right. We simulate this with a support rotation in stage
CS 129. This correction we do in file csm30_c_precamber_site.dat by changing an already
existingdummyloadLC99’unsymmetricsettlement’forstageCS129. Wenowagainworkon
a copy of the database, see input file command +sys copy

In file csm30_c_precamber_site.dat we now calculate this situation with the unchanged pre-

we see that the cantilevers now do not match in midspan:

WenowareinstageCS128andcannotmakechangesforthestagesbefore-theyarealready

We can only make changes for the stages behind and this analysis with additional corrections
is done in file csm30_d_precamber_corr.dat. The primary target to match in midspan can
be achieved easily with an additional ballast in the left sidespan in stage CS 309. But to
SOFiSTiK2023 2-23CSM|TheoreticalBackground
increase the upward curvature of the superstructure right of the first pylon we increase the
cable prestress for the next segments there, see input file. Please notice that we assume that
all segments are already prefabricated and cannot be modified!
With these additional corrections we achieve a good gap closing also in case of this dramatic
unsymmetric pylon settlement:

2.10.1 Optimization on final system without construction stages
Againstthestatementinthelastchapterthatopimizationofdeflectionisnotthefirstgoal,such
an optimization is used in the following example to show the technique. But please notice:
onlyinafinalsystemwithoutconstructionstagesazero-displacement-optimizationgivesgood
results in the bending moment of the superstructure.
The following description is based on the example csm21_eqation_cable_stayed.dat.
Without optimization (without correct cable prestress) the following system will deflect in
midspan and give unbalanced bending moments:
system Deadload on final system
→ unbalanced bending moment
How to find the necessary cable perstress? On final systems without construction stages we
can exceptionally require a zero deflection because here on zero deflection also the bending
in the superstructure will be balanced.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-25CSM|TheoreticalBackground
On this bridge we have 8 degrees of freedom = 8 scalable cable prestress cases:
1 2 3 ... 8
These 8 single prestress loadcases are analyzed on the final system!
As we have 8 scalable loadcases we can wish 8 force or displacement targets:
8: vx=0

Whenall8singleprestressloadcasesareanalyzedonthefinalsystem,theCSMcanbuildan
8*8 equation system that will give the unit factors based on the target conditions:

→gives 8 factors P1-P8
Then running the final system with these 8 factors P1-P8 you get a straight bridge and bal-

2.10.2 Optimization on systems with construction stages
In Systems with construction stages please forget the optimization of displacements! The
SOFiSTiK2023 2-27CSM|TheoreticalBackground
displacements can always be adjusted in a simple (cheap) linear percamber. Concentrate on
the optimization of forces and only use force targets!
The following description is based on the example csm23_cable_stay_optimisation_2.dat.
Inafirstconstructionstagerunwithestimatedcableprestressfactors,newelementsareadded
tangentially (CTRL CANT 2):
Please remember: displacement shape is NOT of interest for the force optimization, because
linear precamber is very cheap and easy in a post run. So we look at the forces:
Cable forces:
Bending moments in superstructure: still unbalanced:
2-28 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
How to get balanced bending moment?
We define our targets, here 8 force-targets (bending moments):
My_pylon = 0.0 kNm
My_pylon = 0.0 kNm
My_pylon = 0.0 kNm
My= My= My= My= My=
-300 -300 -300 -300 -500
8 Targets require 8 scalable loadcases!
As we have only 6 scalable cable prestress loadcases, two more scalable loadcases are re-
quired. We choose two support deflection:
Prestress cable Prestress cable
Prestress cable Prestress cable
Prestress cable Prestress cable
Support Support
lowering lowering
Please consider that the cable prestress loadcases are in time before the insertion of the last
segment and they cannot effect a bending moment in the last segment! So we must find a
scalable loadcase that has an effect on MY-B. Only the support deflection C has an effect on
MY-B.

Withthese8scalableloadcasesv1–v8theCSMoptimizationprogramcancalculate8loadcase
factors P1–P8. Dependencies Sik are now based on the computed construction sequence.
With these factors the complete construction stage analysis now is repeated.
For a linear analysis and if no elements are removed, the targets will be reached in one step.
For nonlinear analysis an iterative loop over the procedure is possible.
In our example we now end in a balanced bending moment:
Target bending moment was 0.0 kNm in the pylon and
-300 kNm in 4 points in beam right of the pylon and -500 at sidespan!
Targets reached !
In a linear post precamber with input
CAMB CS 92 MODE LINE
now also the deformations can be corrected easily.

Overview over the three steps:
1. straight forward CSM run → bad forces + deformation:
2. run with optimized factors → force OK, deformation somehow:
3. Precamber (does not change forces) → forces + deformation OK:

2.10.3 Geometry Opitmization
In a shape optimization in CSM we usually think of a target displacement 0.0 m on traffic
opening = the stressed system on g_1 and g_2 shall have the architectural form.
Beside this you may have a real geometry optimization with the target of a new optimized
system. This is not task of a CSM optimization!
But with standard impCADINP features you can solve such geometry optimization. In the
example geometry_opti_arch.dat the target is a bending free arch under g_1 und g_2.
The example geometry_opti_3d.dat shows the same for a 3d curved compression arch of a
pedestrian bridge.
2.11 Incremental Launching

All workshop YOUTUBE videos are listed in the command GRP, search there for ’Overview
workshop YOUTUBE videos’
On incremental launching parts of the system (superstructure) are launched. The contact to
the supporting structure (piers) is done using moving spring contact elements.
Best define the moving springs on top of the piers and let them point upwards. As these
springs have no fixed contact partner at all, it is best to define them not as coupling spring
but as single spring without node KE (SOFIMSHA: SPRI NO KA DZ upwards CP 1E7). See
2-32 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
e.g. csm40_launching_introduction.dat SOFIMSHA-MESH2: there the spring on the pier
head points upwards and even does not point to a superstructure beam node:
In special cases the springs can also be defined as coupling spring with a sec-
ond node KE, e.g. in case of a graphical input with an inclined direcion see
csm44_incremental_launching_circle_2.dat. The second node KE is exchanged during
launching and slips over the contact rail defined via ASE-MOVS.
2.11.1 Incremental Launching Training - tips and tricks
Please first store file csm40_launching_introduction.dat in a working directory. You can also
store the whole folder program...sofistik/2014/ANALYSIS_30/csm.dat in a working directory to
always have o copy of all examples ready for calculation.
Then please start the file with the preset modules AQUA+MESH6+ASE56+CSM6 +last apply
to get an overview over the final training target.
Handling Instabilies: part MESH1: Not supported superstructure
Please now go to chapter MESH1 of the input file: Not supported superstructure
and start only the SOFIMSHA MESH1 and the following ASE ASE1a.
You will get an error as the system is not yet supported. Please keep calm, open the Animator
and check the instability loadcases 1001-1006.
For a better check please now run the following ASE ASE1b.
There a dynamic stiffness with STEP is added to better check the problem. Due to dead load
now the system accelerates in one second in the direction of earth center. Please check in
Animator. WINGRAF shows following vz:
SOFiSTiK2023 2-33CSM|TheoreticalBackground
First supports: part MESH2: Vertikal Moving Springs
Please calculate SOFIMSHA MESH2 and ASE2a+ASE2b+ASE2c+WING2+ASE2d.
The definition of the upwards pointing moving springs is shown here above before chapter
”Incremental Launching Training”. We recommend to define the effekts vertical-longitudinal-
transvers-rotation in separate springs.
A first ASE run ASE2a direct after SOFIMSHA results in a free fall. Not before the definition
of the moving spring effect in ASE2b, ASE2c will use the desired support contact. All springs
are now looking for a contact to the node rail from #firstnode to #last_node. For checks which
contact has been found please look to the report at the beginning of the ASE ASE2c output:
MOVS-elem 9001 node 1001 contactfactor 1.00 ->on node 1 2 L= 2.500
MOVS-elem 9002 node 1002 contactfactor 1.00 ->on node 11 10 L= 2.500
MOVS-elem 9003 node 1003 contactfactor 1.00 ->on node 21 20 L= 2.500
We readthat movingspring 9001really found 100%contact betweennode 1+2. The following
WING beam-MY plot also shows the correct bending moment including an inner bending part
in beam 1:
ASE2c was again calcualted using an additional dynamic stiffness. Without this in ASE2d
again an error occurs. A check in the Animator shows the missing horizontal and rotational
support.
Stable System with TRAN horizontal fixing: part MESH3:
Please calculate SOFIMSHA MESH3 and ASE3a+ASE3b+ASE3c+ASE3d.
Now the superstructrue is also connected in longitudinal+transverse+rotational direction with
the pier head using ASE-MOVS-L0=TRAN.
The advantage of L0=TRAN is that you can use the same spring node (pier head) for all
effects. Please notice that e.g. spring 11001 was defined with direction DX 1. But due to
L0=TRAN the spring does not look in this x-direction for a contact but searches transverse
2-34 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
(looking perpendicular to the rail) to find a contact between #firstnode and #last_node. The
nearest node is choosen. We look to the report and see that spring 11001 selected only node
1:
MOVS-elem 11001 node 1001 contactfactor 1.00 ->on node 1 L= 1.000
Remember: moving spring 9001 is a main spring (without L0=QUER) and also uses a contact
inside of beam 1!
So transverse springs with L0=TRAN work more simple as they only use one node for the
contact. Buttheycanhandletheadditionalmomentduetotheexcentricityofthecontactforce.
In ASE3b also dead load in x and y direction is calculated to test the support. You should
also test the contact with an feigenfrequency analsis - see ASE3c. You can also start the
Instabilitätscheckmanuelly(otherwiseonlystratetautomaticallyincaseofrealinstability)-see
ASE3d.
With real horizontal rail: part MESH4:
Please calculate SOFIMSHA MESH4 and ASE4a+LOAD4+ASE4b+WING4+ASE4c.
Now we transverse contact is created using a more accurate real moving spring without
L0=TRAN. For this we set a node 7000... hozizontally beside the contact rail (beam refer-
ence point = top center), couple it to the pier head and can now insert a real moving spring
without L0=TRAN (L0 #dhmovs[m]) and direction SOFIMSHA SPRI DY -1 :
In reality the launching rail is on bottom of the section but this is only relevant for torsion due
to horizontal loads. Solutions are shown in chapter ’launching nose’. Optimal usage see see
csm44_incremental_launching_circle_2.dat.
The testloadcases 1+2+3 in ASE4b are again satisfying. In loadcase 901 a single horizon-
tal load is tested. The horizontal contact moving springs group 12 now do not give a mo-
ment excentirity themselves - the excentricity is just performed by the excentic coupling of the
nodes 7000.. In WING4 the target is checked: target Sum-MZ at bottom of piers=400 kNm
(100kN*4m):
SOFiSTiK2023 2-35CSM|TheoreticalBackground
In the last ASE ASE4c now a first lauching is tested. With ASE LAUN the elements of group 1
are shifted in negative x direction:
For checks of the used contact please look to the report at the beginning of each ASE part.
In the last launching with dx=-7.0 m spring 9003 did not find a contact as pier 3 is not yet
reached:
MOVS-elem 9001 node 1001 contactfactor 1.00 ->on node 4 3 L= 2.500
MOVS-elem 9002 node 1002 contactfactor 1.00 ->on node 13 14 L= 2.500
MOVS-elem 9003 node 1003 contactfactor0.000 ->on node 21 L= 2.500
With (too short) launching bed: part MESH5:
Please calculate SOFIMSHA MESH5 and ASE5a+ASE5b ,
after the error in ASE5b calculate also ASE5c.
All elements of the first pier are just copied multiple times and placed in the launching bed.
We not get 17 supports instead of 3 - see STO#nmovs 17. For the superstructure only group
1 is activated. Group 2 is not yet activated to study first construction stages. The first three
construction stages in ASE5b loadcases 101-103 show a correct behavior in the launching
bed. Butloadcase104withdx=-32.00misinstable. ThefollowingcheckruninASE5cLC904

2.11.2 Launching nose
Most important for the launching nose is the idea, that the moving springs always build a con-
tact the the nodal rail. If the slipping rail is horizontal in reality, also the SOFiSTiK a horizontal
nodal contact line from #firstnode to #last_node must be used.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-37CSM|TheoreticalBackground
In the previous training example the superstructure sections were referenced on top of the
secion. Thisisusuallysensefulandrecommendedinbridgedesignbecausewiththisyoucan
easilycreateahaunchedsuperstructure. Usuallythelaunchingnoseisalsohaunchedbutwith
a straight line below.
If the bottom face of the launching nose goes a little bit upwards to help slipping onto the next
pier, also the MOVS contact nodes must get up the same way. You then get big (desired) ver-
tical displacement due to this gap and you can only work with magnitude 1.0 in the animator.
therwise the magnitude would disturb the viewing and trouble the interpretation. Also a non-
linear analysis is required in most cases because otherwise the next pier could pull down the
launching nose (if in reality the gap is not yet closed).
We go back to linear analysis - possible variants:
In Example csm42_incremental_launching.dat the nodal contact line is on top of the super-
structure and the launching nose sections are hanging far beyond the upper superstructure
node line. These sections have their zero point 0-0 upwards outside the material:
Real section view
beams + excentric
sections
nodal line + MOVS
In Example csm44_incremental_launching_circle_2.dat the nose sections are also hanging
far beyond the upper superstructure node line. In addition two separate launching rails are
defined underneath the superstructure. They are coupled with stiff beams (couplings do not
react on a LAUN rotation). Die disadvantage of these bottom-trails is that also the added
internal beam moment of a contact inside the beams is added only on the bottom trail and not
in the superstructure. There it is missing for a design - so use short beams! But the definition
of a rail beyond the superstructure looks very realistic:
2-38 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
Real section view
beams + excentric
sections
nodal line + MOVS
Example csm45_launching_precamber.dat is prepared for nonlineaer launching. The nose
points up a little bit. The nodal contact line lies on top of the superstructure:
Real section view
beams + excentric
sections
nodal line + MOVS
In Example csm46_launching_nose_nonlinear.dat the nose points up as well but the nodal
contact line lies on bottom of the superstructure. All sections are defined with reference point
0-0 on the bottom:
Real section view
beams + excentric
sections
nodal line + MOVS
All variants are correct. The reality is best represented by the system with the two separate
launching rails underneath the superstructure but caution is necessary defining the rail and

coupling sections - see input file.

2.12.1 Superposition and design concept
With little additional input, CSM can perform a quick design, because the most important con-
structioninformation(GPC-parts)isallreadydefinedwiththeconstructionstages. ForEN-1992
the input ACT and DESI are implemented for a prestress design.
Main examples:

Quad: csm32_slab_design.dat YOUTUBE:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FdNbAgwPrI
Main design concept: the program knows everything about the GPC parts and so only the
variable actions must be added:

On GPC: the storage philosophy of the CSM construction stage results GPC (G=dead load,
P=prestress, C=creep+shrinkage) is explained in chapter ”Load Cases - Primary Load Cases
- Difference Load Cases” in a graphical plot. The CSM also prints the following overview of
loadcases:

2.12.2 Superposition with the variable actions
In a first presuperposition, the variable actions are combined without GPC (G=dead load,
P=prestress, C=creep+shrinkage) in a first separate MAXIMA run (see following graphic).
Fortherare(characteristic)actioncombinationRAREtheproducedmax-minforcesarestored
in a presuperposition KOMB ... TYPE Y_1 ans stored with load case numbers 1141-1152. In
some codes with LC 1161-1172 an additional combination traffic + wind without temperature
is created also TYPE Y_1, LC 1141-1152 then contains temperature without wind. For wind
without traffic a further presuperposition Y_1 is created (e.g. loadcase number 1181-1192),
see ACT ZW+SW.
AfollowingMaximarunthencreatesthefinalcombinationRAREwiththeprecombinationsY_1
and the permanent actions GPC in loadcase 1121-1132 (G=dead load, P=prestress, C=C+S.
- from CSM construction stage analysis).
In the same way precombinations and final MAXIMA combinations for nonfrequent with Y_2
LC 1200ff, frequent with Y_3 LC 1300ff, permanent with Y_4 LC 1400ff and if necessary for
Y_9 1900ff with 1.0 psi-values for reaction forces are created. For design inclusive the load
safetyfactorsGAMUthecombinationDESI(presuperpositionY_D)withLC2100.ffiscreated,
SOFiSTiK2023 2-41CSM|TheoreticalBackground
for a simplified stress range check FATI with LC 2500.ff.
These final combinations are used directly for QUAD elements e.g. for a design in BEMESS -
LF DESI.
Using prestressed or composite sections, the load parts GPC must be assigned to cross sec-
tionconstructionstages(netto,ideell). ThusthepartsGPCmustbedefinedinAQBseparately,
e.g. LC 5010 TYPE ’G_1 ’ CT CS0 REF PART. These LC definitions are summarized in block
#include loadca_aqb. The corresponding variable actions are then added with the prepared
precombination Y_1 to Y_D , e.g. COMB MAXR LC1 G LC2 P LC3 C LC4 Y_1 1.0 LCST
For graphical checks the forces and stresses of the AQB combinations are stored with COMB
LCST. For this the following sceme will be used:
OVERVIEW CREATED LOADCASES AND DESIGN NUMBERS
convention loadcase numbering:
1100 = rare combination
1200 = nonfrequent combination
1300 = frequent combination
1400 = permanent combination
1900 = 1.0 superposition
2100 = design
2500 = accidential
2600 = earthquake
2800 = Fatigue LM3 2900 = Fatigue simplified stress range LM1
For WINGRAF-views: MAXIMA superpostion results start with MAX or MIN in the loadcase
title, all other titles come from AQB combinations! Only for the BEAM-AQB-combinations the
LC number is further devided in:
10-th number: 00 = 100 % prestress
70 = 75 % prestress -> loadcase 9000...
90 = 90 % prestress -> loadcase 9000...
10 = 110 % prestress
20+30 = 90 % prestress fatigue LM1+LM3 -> 9000...
1-th number: 0+1 = maximum/minimum value uncracked design I
5+6 = maximum/minimum value cracked design II
With this convention we get the following AQB-LCST-loadcase numbers:
(9000.. numbers with prestress other than 100 %,
design of construction stages with numbers +400).

2.12.4 Design
Please also watch the YOUTUBE video ’CSM DESI Bridge Design’ on this topic:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoCshbOx5qo (YOUTUBE video CSM DESI)
After a presuperposition a design can be startet with CSM DESI. So the forces can correctly
be transfered to the design modules.
Main examples:
Beam: csm31_design.dat
2-44 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
Quad: csm32_slab_design.dat
2.12.5 Design check print
PleasealwaysstartwithafirstCSMDESICHEKCheckPrintrunforasingleelementselected

print of the linear normal stresses should be checked in any case. Following you get a check
of the ULS and crack design of one single beam:
Figure2.16: CSMDESICheckPrintforasingleselectedbeamelement
How to check the combination factors is written there in the created _chek.dat input file at
chapter Check-print ULS design
-> +PROG AQB $ Check Print ULS design at the COMB combinations.
For this and other checks there also exists a YOUTUBE video ’CSM DESI Bridge Design’: ->
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in8OTk24f1U
In a quad design you can select a quad with SELE X,Y,Z. Then you get stress plots and
numerical output for this quad in the BEMESS runs. For further checks on quad design see
also example voided_slab.dat
2.12.6 Sequence of design tasks
To not get confused by the huge amount of results we recommend to let them run separate
(e.g. only DESI ULTI as shown in csm31_design.dat ). Then you can better check the results
separate and you have a better overview.
UsingSSDyoubestinsertmultipleCSM-DESIGNtaskswithonlyonedesigntaskeach. Using
Teddyyoucanalsoopene.g. thecreated_gzt.datfileandrunandchecktheresultsseparate.
Please notice that with every CSM-DESI run also a WINGRAF .gra file is created. In this file
the actual result plots are already prepared for interactive changes (box, groups):

- Please open windows explorer and double klick on file _uls.gra
- Or open WINGRAF and from there open file _uls.gra
- Or in SSD: insert a task ’Interactive graphics’ and from there open file
Then please immediately store the .gra file under another name to keep your changes. With a
CSM-DESI STAN run (here at the end) you can also get an overview over the possible design
tasks.

2.12.8 Why AQB AND MAXIMA superposition
Why AQB: because forces can act on different cross section stages:
1. Post-tensioned prestress P and structural dead load G_1 act on a partial cross sec-
tion with the ungrouted duct and do not create an additional stress change in the
tendon (still unbonded). (We assume that while stressing the tendon, the girder lifts
from the formwork and simultaneously activates G_1)
2. Additional dead load G_2 acts on the grouted cross section ( with tendon in bond)
and creates a stress change in the tendon. Therefore we should not mix G_1 and
G_2 before the design! After a pre-superposition it is not possible to separate those
effects!
3. Moreover in composite sections, the dead load G_1 usually acts on the steel part of
the section and the dead load G_2 acts on the composite steel and concrete.
4. Creep and shrinkage C create internal stress stages that cannot be taken into ac-
count in MAXIMA. In a composite section, shrinkage creates tension in the concrete
and compression in the steel while the external forces N and MY are zero. In pre-
stressedsectionsthelossofprestressduetocreepandshrinkageisonlyaninternal
stress state, the external forces N and MY are zero as well (without secondary ef-
fects). See also figure dataflow in chapter loadcases.
5. Allthevariableloadcases,thatactonthefinalsectioncanbepre-superimposedina
MAXIMAcontainere.g. Y_D(CSM-DESIEurocodedesign-seecsm31_design.dat).
Why MAXIMA: because AQB only works on beams:
1. All other elements like springs, cables or quads and support reactions do not have
2-46 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
internalsectionstagesandcanbesuperimposedinMAXIMAcompletely. Quadscan
directly be designed with the MAXIMA result forces (tendons in quad elements work
in a different way than tendons in beam elements).
2.12.9 Primary and secondary (hyperstatic) effect of prestress
In general 2*2 prestress factors are possible. For two different usage A and B always two
different actions are possible in SOFiSTiK:
Usage A: different factors rsup e,g, in decompression check
1. ACT P_0 : for pre-tensioning or unbonded tendons:
rsup = 1.05 and rinf = 0.95
2. ACT P_1 : for post-tensioning with bonded tendons:
rsup = 1.10 and rinf = 0.90
Usage B: Separation of primary and secondary (hyperstatic) effect of prestress
1. ACT PB : primary effect of prestress
2. ACT ZP : secondary (hyperstatic) effect of prestress (redistribution)
Due to the complexity only these literal shall be used!
The CSM can handle these 2 sets of actions and uses them in AQB combinations automati-
cally:
in usage A CSM uses Set P_0 and P_1
CSM writes for AQB e.g. COMB ... LC1 P_0 0.95 LC2 P_1 0.90
see csm3_P_0_P_1.dat -> first PROG CSM -> CTRL PKIN 0.95 V2 0.90
(decompression check)
in usage B CSM uses Set PB and ZP
CSM writes for AQB e.g. COMB ... LC1 PB 0.90 LC2 ZP 1.00
see csm31_design.dat -> last CSM -> DESI FAT PAR3 0.9 PAR4 1.00
(fatigue check according EN1992-1-1 5.10.9)
So it is not allowed to mix usage A and B. For manual input it is not allowed to mix P_0 and
P_1 with PB and ZP.

2.12.10 Fatigue checks beam elements - reinforcement distribution numbers
IncasesettlementortemperatureactionsaredefinedintheCSMDESIMAXIrun,theinduced
MAXIMA creates a container Y_8 (combination TEMP_SETZ) that combines the most unfa-
vorable forces of settlement and temperature. In the AQB run then in a loop in a time one of
theseY_8loadcases(LC1841...) isusedaspermanentpartandthestressrangeiscalculated
with the fatigue acting FAT loadcases. With DESI FAT PAR1 0 no temperature or settlement
loadcases are taken into account.
If necessary and possible, the reinforcement is increased in the fatigue design. An additional
SOFiSTiK2023 2-47CSM|TheoreticalBackground
loop performs the check one time for pk-inf and one time for pk-sup.
As for different span and support locations different axle load factors (1.40 und 1.75) must be
applied, three AQB design runs are started: - In a first run with axle load factor 1.40 (span)
for all elements the reinforcement fatigue check is done. The used or increased reinforcement
is stored in design case 23. The maximum stresses can be plotted in Wingraf under the AQB
LCST loadcase storage number. See "Overview result access beam elements in WINGRAF"
in the CSM DESI report.
-Withthepossibleincreasedreinforcementthentheconcretecheckwithaxleloadfactor1.0is
done. The results of this run can be plotted in Wingraf under the AQB LCST loadcase storage
number. This block runs after the span run with factor 1.40 to use the may be increased
reinforcement!
- Finally the design for support regions is done with axle load factor 1.75 for all elements. The
used or increased reinforcement is stored in design case 25. The user then has to decide
manually, if a beam must be assigned to span or support region and if for this beam either
design case 23 or 25 is relevant.
Generally the used or increased reinforcement is always stored in a new design case. This is

applied as permanent part. Only the fatigue acting FAT loadcases are set as aötermative part
in this superposition. The so created MAXIMA superposition loadcases are then designed for
fatigue in BEMESS and the reinforcement is increased if necessary. Then the next MAXIMA-
BEMESS block follows with another permanent Temp_Settlement part. A check with pk-sup is
not done for Quad slab- or shell elements.
As for different span and support locations different axle load factors (1.40 und 1.75) must be
applied, the above mentioned technique runs three times: - In a first run with axle load factor
1.40 (span) the reinforcement fatigue check is done. The used or increased reinforcement is
stored in design case 17. The maximum stresses and stress ranges can be plotted in Wingraf
under design case 17. See "Overview result access quad elements in WINGRAF" in the CSM
DESI report.
- With a possible increased reinforcement a run with axle load factor 1.75 for support regions
isdone. TheresultsofthisruncanbeplottedinWingrafunderdesigncase18. Themaximum
stresses and stress ranges can be plotted in Wingraf under design case 18. The user may
decide manually, if an element must be assigned to span or support region and if for this quad
either design case 17 or 18 is relevant. Nevertheless for the following design only the upper
reinforcementisovertakenfromdesigncase18(CTRLLCRI18V22)asusuallyonlytheupper
reinforcement is of interest for support regions. The lower reinforcement is taken from design
case 17 as the lower reinforcement is usually only of interest in the span region.
- Finally the fatigue design for concrete is done with axle load factor 1.00 for all elements. The
results of this run can be plotted in Wingraf under design case 19.
Generally the used or increased reinforcement is always stored in a new design case. This is

We noticed that at the end you need the same technique for a design in a construction stage
asyouuseitforthedesignofthefinalstage. Usuallyyoualsoneedadditionalpayload,lifeload
and windload.
Soweusedthecontainerdesignconceptalsoforthedesignofconstructionstage. Inexample
file csm34_stage_design.dat you canfollow the workflowin the CSM part’Construction stage
design’ as follows:
- LCCS additional loadcases for this CS design
- DECS input of the construction stage number
- DESI required designs for this construction stage
- COPY storage of results - then you can plot an envelope
of multiple construction stage designs in WINGRAF
Comments:
With LCCS additional loadcases for this stage design are defined. In a first created ASE run
they are analyzed with the necessary GRP setting for this stage ()see ASE: GRP ’CSM’ CS
209). Then they are presuperposed in Containers. Best open the created _decs.dat file and g
to the MAXIMA part:
- Presuperposition actions without wind without GPC
ThereyouseehowtheinputofLCCSisusedforthecontainerpresuperposition: theloadcases
are devided in the actions (LCCS-ACT). The safety factors are taken from the aciton definition
of the main database, here from the first SOFILOAD run. The settings for SUPP EXCL or
SUPP COND are also takten from there but can be overwritten with LCCS TYPE temporarily.
The further analysis and the usage of the GPC parts follows the same technique as in a final
stage design with the only difference that not all GPC parts are used but only the parts op to
stage CS (in MAXIMA and the created AQB runs).
AsinallstagedesignsthesamestressloadcasenumbersLCSTandreinforcementdistribution
numbers LCR are used it is necessary to save them in new different numbers as follows:
With COPY the results of a construction stage design can be copied to other numbers. With
COPY AUTO the results are automatically copied in 600000... target loadcases.
To keep the main database small it is also a good idea to copy the stage design results into
a separate database. But this special-case-possibility with CSM COPY ... cdb name2 is not
used in the example files to keep the method simple.
More clear to design multiple stages is the following method:
You best control multiple construction stage designs in a separate inputfile
csm34_stage_design_all.dat using simple COPY commands. Then of course you can remove
the corresponding construction stage design parts in the main file csm34_stage_design.dat
and better place the final design in the main file. Please notice that the .cdb copy command
for this usage is positioned in the main file after the main CSM analysis run, see
2-50 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalBackground |CSM
+sys copy $(name).cdb csm34_stage_design_all.cdb
In case you made the final design in the main file you can use COPY at the end do copy and
superpose the stage and final designs in a third separate design .cdb.
2.13.1 Removal of temporary supports: GPCS: further separation of GPC parts
To illustrate the effect, csm36_gpc_separated.dat shows a simple single span girder. The
values were choosen in a way that G and P just give 0.0 in midspan. Calculated in the ’cast in
one’ system we get Sum G+P=0:
G cast in one: Mg=+10000 kNm
delta P alone: Mp=-10000 kNm
sum G+P: Mg+p= 0 kNm
ULS: 1.35G + P: M-ULS= 3500 kNm
But if we erect the system on temporary bearings (in green) without separation of stage ’re-
moval of supports’ we also get an SLS Sum G+P=0, but the parts G and P get other values
and ULS 1.35G+P gives a different result:
G on temp. support dMg=+3750 kNm
G+P CSM: dMp=-4020 kNm
remove temp. support dMb= 270 kNm
sum CSM stages: Mg+p+b= 0 kNm
ULS: 1.35GB + P: M-ULS= 1412 kNm
The problem is that building stage B ’remove temp. support’ consists of two parts, a G and
a P part. With CTRL GPCS 1 these parts can be separated and we can get the correct ULS
bending moment M-ULS= 3500 kNm also with construction stages:
difference loadcase: dead loads prestress
50010 Selfweight g_1 3752 -
50011 Prestress - -4018 kNm
110030 Removal of temporary supports part G 6255 - GPCS separated
120030 Removal of temporary supports part P - -5984 GPCS separated
--------- ---------
sum 10007 -10003 kNm
G+P = 4 kNm = OK
and ULS 1.35 G +1.00 P = 1.35*10007 -10003= 1.35G +P = 3500 kNm = OK
So the advantage of CTRL GPCS 1 is that stage LC 50030 is devided into two parts G and P
SOFiSTiK2023 2-51CSM|TheoreticalBackground
in LC 110030 and 120030 !
Internal workflow (controlled in the _csm.dat file):
- at first a CS-sequence runs with only G loads -> LC 110000
- then a CS-sequence runs with only P loads -> LC 120000
- finally a normal CS-sequence runs with all loads-> LC 50000
- parallel the LC 130000 is created with LC 130000 = 50000-110000-120000

3.1 Input Language
The input is made in the CADINP language (see general manual SOFiSTiK: ’FEA / STRUC-
TURAL Installation and Basics’).
Three categories of units are distinguished:
mm Fixed unit. Input is always required in the specified unit.
[mm] Explicit unit. Input defaults to the specified unit. Alternatively, an explicit as-
signment of a related unit is possible (eg. 2.5[m] ).
[mm] Implicit unit. Implicit units are categorised semantically and denoted by a cor-
1011
responding identity number (shown in green). Valid categories referring to the
unit ”length” are, for example, geodetic elevation, section length and thickness.
Thedefaultunitforeachcategoryisdefinedbythecurrentlyactive(designcode
specific) unit set. This input default can be overridden as described above. The
specified unit in square brackets corresponds to the default for unit set 5 (Eu-
rocodes, NORM UNIT 5).

CTRL BEAM TBEA
is used to contol slab systems with enbedded beams working with the SOFiSTiK T-
beam philosophy. Then the cross sectional internal losses due to prestress are calcu-
lated in AQB. The creep curvature is then not taken from AQB but computed in ASE
because ASE modifies the beam stiffness for the SOFiSTiK T-beam philosophy.
CTRL EMOD - Development of stiffenss of concrete elements
CSM calculates now the temperature adjusted concrete age T1 according to CEB-
FIP model code 1990 (2.1-87) and writes this age T1 to the ASE GRP input. The
age GRP...T0 must be given temperature adjusted! ASE then takes into account the

for checks.
CTRL B_G1 - Saving of the construction stages as type G_1
With this the construction stages can be allocated to the type G_1 for the superposi-
tion.
The input NO stores the construction stages B as type B and not as type G_1. The
default CTRL B_G1 YES stores them as type G_1 to avoid problems in MAXIMA.
CTRL GAMC - Factor for the consideration of the support moment due to creep
If two single spans are placed, at the middle support the bending moment is 0.0 in
the beginning. After closing the gap, only creep activates a bending moment there.
In the ultimate limit state, this force must be considered as G with the unfavourable
factorofGAMU=1.35(1.40forBritishStandard)becausethemomentrepresentsdead
load (or comes from dead load). The moment creeps into the direction of the cast in
one bending moment - and in the cast in one system this moment is a dead load
moment! Thus the statically indeterminate parts of creep and shrinkage are activated
withGAMCintheultimatelimitstateforbeamstructures,ifatleastoneBconstruction

e.g. CTRL PKIN 0.95 for prestress with immediate bond.
Default 0.90 (later grouting). Pk,sup is set equivalent (1.05 for CTRL PKIN 0.95). For

The value for PKIN is used for P generally, in any case for P_0.

Change of ASE CTRL values in a CSM sequence:
The variable #cs_csm is set in every ASE run and can be used to change e.g. the
concrete tensile strength in stages:
PROG CSM
ctrl ase text ’CTRL CONC V4 2.50 ’
ctrl ase text ’if xxx_cs_csm<25 ; CTRL CONC V4 0.80 ; endif’
This uses CTRL CONC V4 2.50 in ASE in the first stages up to CS 25 and CTRL
CONC V4 0.80 for the stages greater equal 26.
As SSD, TEDDY and WPS immediately perform a variable substitution, the variable
#cs_csm must be written as xxx_cs_csm<25 in the CSM input. The CSM then uses
#cs_csm in the created _csm.dat file. See also example csm48_spiral_ani.dat

R earth pressure, also allowed as R_1, R_2...
Attention: if you use R or R_1 in CSM as construction stage, the earth pressure
will be taken into account as variable action! That is OK if the earth pressure is
small compared to the other variable actions. But if the earth pressure is very
high it may happen that it will not be applied as favorable as the container of the
variable actions may not be applied due to their GAMF 0.

T0-TS:
For shrinkage now an age TS of 3 days is set by default, With the new input GRP...TS this
can be changed in CSM. Physically shrinkage starts at this age TS. The analyis creep and
shrinkage intervals start at T0 (loading age). So in the first creep and shrinkage interval T0
to T0+T the shrinkage part from TS to T0 is not applied! This is correct for the standard case
prestresswithsubsequentbondwhereprestressC+SlossstartsatT0. Withthesamereason
also the total shrinkage value does not include this first shrinkage part from TS to T0!
In steel composite sections it is necessary to take into account the first shrinkage part from
TS up to the start of loading. To do this you must input T0=TS= 1 day, see example
steel_composite_orto.dat .
For in situ concrete slab on a prerefabricated beam T0 may not be input too small because
thentheconcretewounldbetooweakforfirstdeadloadG_1orprestressing. Thusinexample
csm3_composite_beam.dat T0=3 andTS=1 is set for group 10. Completely correct could also
be to input T0=TS= 1 day, calculate the first activation of the beams without dead load (GRP
FACD), then add a creep step with e.g. 7 days and then activate dead load G_1 and following

SITU:
For cross sections having an additional cast in-situ part, one can define the activation of the
additional deadload of higher construction stages with SITU without taking into account their
additional stiffness. With SITU>ICS1 the full section weight is activated in stage SITU. With
GRP SITU -1 the weight of a section part can be activated one stage before the activation of
the stiffness.

GRP SITU -5 activates the weight already 5 stages before the stiffness activation.
If dead load shall be activated later: with GRP SITU 10000+n the dead load of a part of a
section can be activated n steps later than the stiffness.

EPS is also allowed in the real creep. The program then scales the internal calculated eps
valuestotheenforcedinputvalueEPS.ButthenAQBwillnotuseavariableeffectivethichness
per beam but will only use the CSM printed average value per group. So it is better to use a
simple factor to shinkage, best possible in AQUA with MEXT TYP EIGE VAL3+5, see material
3 in explicit_creep_curve.dat.
QUAD-elements: without an input to CREP...DEFQ, the CSM computes an averaged value for
theeffectivethicknessoverallQUADelementsofeachgroup. Duetotopcoveringofquadsin
nearly all circumstances (bad air contact), the default effective thickness for quad elements is
set to 1.40*h.
For BRIC elements the effective member thickness must be input for the BRIC groups.

EACR factor on the E*A stiffness of the quad slab for creep − -
and shrinkage
UsingtheASETBEXT-beam-philosophy,thebeamelementsofthelongitudinalsuperstructure
and the quad elements of the deck slab usually get different creep and shrinkage coefficients
due to a different effective thickness. This sometimes causes unexpected slight redistribution
of forces between the beam elements and the quad deck slab.
With CSM TBEX the E*A stiffness of the quad deck slab can be reduced for creep and shrink-
age analysis. Then the moments and normal forces are better comparable with the results of
a pure beam analysis. All other stages such as G or P run with the full isotropic E*A quad
stiffness.
To the TBEX T-beam-philosophy please also refer to ASE manual TBEX.
Example see t_beam_bridge_excentric.dat
There the CSM TBEX is commented out but we did run the example without slab prestress
and the check print delivers nearly same stresses with/without CSM TBEX EACR 1E-5
Of course you are not allowed to reduce E*A stiffness if you have a transverse slab prestress
because otherwise the compression of the tendons cannot be carried.

DESI runs without ACT then the individual checks can be performed.
Main examples:
Beam: csm31_design.dat
Quad: csm32_slab_design.dat
DESI MAX, MAXI:
With DESI MAX only the MAXIMA parts run. For WINGRAF then all forces for the following
superposition are stored:
- LC 1120 .. rare (characteristic) superposition
- LC 1220 .. nonf ”
- LC 1320 .. freq ”
- LC 1420 .. perm ”
- LC 2120 .. desi ”
To be used for support reactions, spring-, quad- and beam forces for beams without
composite or prestress! Beams composite or prestress must be treated with AQB (DESI
STAN...)!
With DESI MAXI also an AQB linear stress analysis runs. So also for composite beams
thelinearstressesarestoredforWINGRAFfortheabovementionedsuperpositions(loadcase
numbers can be seen in the created _desi.dat → AQB-COMB-GMAX-LCST).
For checks in cracked state the funktions DESI ULTI or DESI STAN should be used.
Fatigue check
With the traffic loads of load model 1 a simplified fatigue check will be performed for DESI
STAN:
1. Stress analysis for 75% prestress for welded connections and tendon couplings acc.
DIN 1045 10.8.4. or EN 1992-1-1 6.8.6
2. Simplifiedfatigue checkacc. DIN 104510.8.4 orEN1992-1-1 6.8.6: stressrange <
70 mPa
If in ACT an action FAT [fatigue] is declared, the exact check follows. Additional input for time
of usage and amount of traffic are preset in file _desi.dat and have to be checked. Without
an input of a high minimum reinforcement the fatigue check will not succeed in most cases,
becauseaccordingtoDINFB-102(4.3.7.3)orEN1992-1-16.8.6oftenaveryhighbondfactor
eta will be adopted.

Superposition and design concept:
In the first presuperposition MAXIMA run the superposition of the variable action without GPC
(G=dead load, P=prestress, C=creep+shrinkage) is defined.
InafollowingsecondMAXIMArunthissuperpositionisdone,theresultsarestordincontainer
Y_1 ... Y_9 (without GPC).
In two following Maxima runs the same is done including GPC for e.g. quad design, spring
results or nodal deformations.
A following AQB beam design uses these container Y_1 ... Y_9 of the variable actions and
adds the section depending force and inners stress states G,P and C
On AASHTO the literals are often used as follows: GPC -> D,PS,CR (D=dead load,

The crack design in AASHTO is mainly a steel stress limitation according equation 5.6.7-1
depending on the concrete cover, the bar diameter and the bar distance:
Figure3.2: AASHTOequation5.6.7-1forcrackdesign
We recommend to calculate the allowable steel stress by hand (e.g. 220 N/mm2, represents
1.1 o/oo strain) and compare this stress with the results of the DESI SIG run. In special cases
you can make an AQB SLS design with input of a maximum steel strain S2, e.g. with AQB -

Incaseofagivenconstructionstageanalysisandif5000-CSloadcasesareusedasscalable
loadcases, in EQLC TYPE G the target loadcase must be specified. This target loadcase is
used as default in EQUU...EQBE for target consgtruction stage CS.
In order to optimize the internal forces and moments it is also possible to define target condi-
tions in previous construction stages, see csm25_equation_cable_removal.dat.
With a following loadcase F after a scalable loadcase the two loadcases get the same factor
and count as on condition.
Remarks using optimizations in a construction staged analysis:
Main goal of the equation technique is the optimization of a desired force state!
e.g. good bending moment distribution in the superstructure (main beam)
(or for an arch bridge: good bending moment distribution in the arch)
(or for a cable stayed bridge: no bending moment in pylon)
Thus usually no displacement targets should be used in the Equation technique.
If the desired force state is reached, the precamber is very easy
in linear systems → UEBE ... MODE LINE. This even does not
require a new analysis (only correction run at the end):
Just the starting deformations are modified and as
in linear systems the deformations has no additional effect on the forces,
the system must not be reanalyzed!→ see csm23_cable_stay_optimisation_2.dat.
Only in case of nonlinear systems an iteration is necessary → csm29_precamber_nonl.dat
The optimization technique is also well shown in Theoretical Background - Shape and force
optimization.

Example see csm24_equation_iteration_creep.dat.
For example with EQIT 20 FMAX 1.5 it is possible to prevent a too great modification of the
new load case factors. A negative value for FMAX e.g. -0.7 activates a old iteration method
regula-falsi. A positive value (deafult) uses a Crisfield acceleration as used in ASE.
With e.g. EQIT 5 COPY 80000 the highest target loadcase 4000+CS-max (CS-max maximum
of all EQBE CS) is copied after every iteration (e.g. for CS-max=701):
LC 80000 = loadcase 4701 before the first EQIT iteration = start state
LC 80001 = loadcase 4701 after the 1. EQIT iteration
LC 80002 = loadcase 4701 after the 2. EQIT iteration

In a first table the angles for the main plane are printed (s-z plane).
Three parts are taken into account. In color red the possible corresponding displacement is
shown.
a1 Rotation of the nodal line with angle α. For SYST GDIR NEGZ (global z points
up), α of stays rotates up, for SYST GDIR POSZ α rotates downwards!
In hangers, α rotates opposite to local t, see figure 3.5 and 3.6

a3 Rotation of the superstructure or pylon at the cable anchorage (nodal rotation)
- direction s is the direction of the cable from node A to node E in the ground view
- for hangers s points into the local x axis of the bottom node
-apositiverotationα meansanincreaseofzindirections,inhangersincreaseoflocaluinss
- only formulars for a flat stressed cable are used -> a2A = -a2E
- if a nonlinear sagging from ASE-TH3 is provided it is taken
- for linear loadcases fz is analyzed from the normal force using H0
- for this only deadload in z is supposed
- except for TYPE DIFF also linear loadcases must include dead load and prestress
- horizontal cable sagging is also inluded if available (wind in ASE-TH3)
The real end tangent inclination for a cable in a loadcase in the main plane is:
(in the above figure global z falls from A to E - so -h must be inserted:)
- at the startnode A : real end tangent inclination αA = ATAN(+-h/(l-xy) +a1 -a2E
- at the end-node E : real end tangent inclination αE = ATAN(+-h/(l-xy) +a1 +a2E
Asonlythedifferencetothecableanchoragetnthesuperstructureisofinterest,therotationa3
mustbesubstracted. Alsoonlytherangeoftheanglescomparedtootherloadcaseisrelevant,
so the often big number ATAN(+-h/(l-xy) is not printed in the output values daA and daE and
we get:
- at the startnode A : daA = +a1 -a2E -a3A = change of the cable anchorage for a loadcase
-attheend-nodeE:daE=+a1+a2E-a3E.(comparedtothesystemangleATAN(+-h/(l-xy))
Together with the value for the permanent loadcase you get all necessary values with the
printed min. and max. values for the main plane.
3.35.2 Main and transverse plane, skew direction
In a separate table also transverse angles due to transverse effects are printed and combined
with the main plane rotations. Again three parts are taken into account but now in the local
coordinate system ss-t-u of the cable. It is defined as follows, cable no. 14001 in example
csm21_cable_anchorage_angle_3d.dat with wind in transverse direction:
- direction ss is the direction of the cable from node A to node E
- direction u is perpendicular to ss in the direction of global Z
- for hangers u points into the local x axis of the bottom node
- direction t is the local transverse direction
- also horizontal cable sagging is inluded if available (wind in ASE-TH3)

In the fixed directions u and t the angle differences are now also printed relative to the perma-

a1,a2,a3,da and daperm are the same rotations as in the outprint of the main plane (α rotates
from ss to u = opposite to local t),
t1,t2,t3,dt and dtperm are rotations in transverse direction t (from ss to t = positive around the
u-axis).
Due to a combined sagging in u and t direction a maximum skew angle change can occur,
printed in column ’skew’. This is also an angle relative to the permanent situation.

This function has not much to do with the CSM itself. But it may help do design compression
members.
MEX makes a copy of a loadcase and increases the bending moments in beams and quads if
the normalforce is compression. In Quads this is done in the two main normal force directions
using only ex_q
example:
+PROG CSM
HEAD
MEX lc 15 diff 100000 ex_z 60[mm] ex_y 30[mm]
end
EX_R 60[mm] will give e.g. for N=-1000kN and MY=300kNm and MZ=-400kNm
-> skew main moment = 500kNm:
delta-M= 0.060*1000 = 60kNm in direction of the skew main moment:
delta-MY= 60kNm*300/500 = 36kNm -> MY= 300+36 = 336kNm
delta-MZ= 60kNm*400/500 = 48kNm -> MZ= -400-48 = -448kNm
On MY=0 and MZ=0 , EX_R is applied for both directions.
If you want to vary the excentricities per group you can input following lines without LC and
DIFF, example:

This function has not much to do with the CSM itself. But it may help do design compression
members.
‚Real system’ means that for the concrete slab and for the steel beam separate elements are
used. The beam section only represents the steel girder and is hanging eccentrically below
the slab.
A positive bending of the total system delivers a tension normal force in the beam. Near the
supports the normal force in the beam decreases from one beam to the next. This jump in the
beam force represents the bond force.
With the command BOND this jump in the normal force between two beams is stored as bond
force and it is no longer necessary to define complicated spring connectors to extract the
bond force. After BOND, WINGRAF offers design-beams-stress of the material-Shear in dow-
els/welds
A little bit critical is the use of Maxima oder Ella load cases as usually different basic load
cases are used on two neighboring beams. So you should not use the Maxima load cases
Max-Min-VZ as the sign of the shear force jumps inside the span.
We recommend to use the Maxima load case Max-Min-N. This load case contains the max-
imum normal force in mid span and it is guaranteed that this normal force is transferred via
the beam jumps as bond force up to the support. Only the distribution maybe shifted a little
bit to the supports. We recommend an additional shift of the maximum bond force into the
direction of midspan. It may also be senseful to calculate the maximum traffic combination for
the maximum bending moment in midspan as a separate ASE loadcase and then also take
into account the bond force of this separate loadcase.

You best fix the curvature for the most important element, usually the superstructure beams
e.g. with a heigth of 1.80 m.
If we want to apply e.g. a dT/h of +7°C we have to apply 7°/1.80m (DT=7 , HM=1.80[m]).
In the height of the center of gravity of the main girder at SM=0.656 m no longitudinal strain
shall occur, dt shall be 0.0 there.
This leads to a surface temperature of -0.656m*7°/1.80m = -2.53°

E.g. a 0.25m thick slab may only get 1.00°/0.25m.
To get the same longitudinal elongation on the top of the bridge we get:
top of main beam -2.53°C bottom +4.47°C = beam
top 0.45m slab -2.53°C bottom -0.78°C = quad loading

4.1 4-span Bridge With Stepwise Construction
Figure4.1: 4-spanBridge
A 4-span bridge is build in construction stages. A detailed description is found in theoretical
principles - precamber - see also example csm26_precamber_spanbyspan.dat
4.2 Two Span Girder Creeping
Figure4.2: TwoSpanGirderCreeping
Two single girders are put in place and then connected. Due to creep and shrinkage the
bending moment will change from a single span distribution to a twospan distribution.
The activation and fixing of the beam hinge runs automatically with the CSM...GRP...HING
input - please refer to ASE...GRP...HING.
4.3 Precast Girder Bridge With Cast In Situ Deck
Essentiell important in this example is the definition of the composite section in AQUA, using
the AQUA...SECT...CS technique. This controlls together with the CSM...GRP input the acti-
vation of a varying cross section stiffness. The connection of the two singls span girders to a
two span system is done with short connection beams. Different support springs are switched
on and off in different construction stages. Please look at the produced sectional stress plots
at the end of the csm3..._csm.dat run.

4.7 Multistorey - Incremental Erection
Also during the stepwise erection of a building, restraint forces appear. They can be analyzed
in a realistic way with the CSM.
