1 Task Description
GRAPHIC is a graphical program for the finite element and framework analysis modules of
SOFiSTiK with a CDBASE database (e.g. TALPA, ASE, STAR2, MAXIMA, BEMESS, AQB,
DYNA, HASE or HYDRA). The program allows the representation of almost all information
saved in the database. These ones are in particular:
Structures: Elements and nodes with or without numbers
Support conditions
Elastic foundations
Cross sections and cross section values
Material values
Local coordinate systems
Results: Principal stresses or principal moments as well as normal
stresses
(for plane structures according to magnitude and direction)
Nodal and element loads
Reinforcements in areas (contour lines)
Non–linear stresses, strains and crack widths
Vectors of velocities
Potential values
Deformed structure
Bending forms of structure
Internal forces and deformations for frame and girder systems
Influence lines
Beam loads
Beam stiffnesses
Maximum stresses
Reinforcements
The graphical representation can occur according to the result type in different manner:
– Single lines or arrows with defined (scaled) length
– Numerical values
– Designations
– Line representations for frame and girder systems or for
– Cuts in plane structures
– Isolines
– Hatch or fill patterns

2 WINDOWS Version
2.1 General Information
An interactive surface (GMEN) exists for the operating WINDOWS systems.
An arbitrary input file can be read, graphical modifications can occur and an input file can be
outputagainwiththisinteractiveversion. Inthiscasetheinteractiveprocessingcanbeomitted
for a new calculation of a known system.
The drawings are arranged into graphics, pictures and layers. Every layer contains drawing
elements (vectors, lines, text,...). A picture can consist of one or several layers which can
lie over each other. A graphics is divided in one or several pictures which are positioned
side by side.
The WINDOWS version allows the direct layout of a representation with an immediate check
of the result. The parameters can be changed or a new drawing can be requested if a picture
is not liked.
Two variants of the representation of result types are possible with the program GRAPHIC:
1. the Edit box
2. the result tree
The working with the result tree is suitable for the fast generation of the desired pictures with-
out user–specific definitions. The processing with the Edit box is recommended, if specific
definitions become desired or necessary.
2.2 Start of the WINDOWS Version
The following possibilities are suitable for the start of GRAPHIC:
Start from the TEDDY or WPS via a click at the GRAPHIC icon
A data base (.CDB) is opened. If a storage file .GRA is available, this is used
with first priority.
Double click at the program symbol GRAPHIC icon at the desktop.
Use of the right mouse button at a SOFiSTiK data base file (.CDB).
SOFiSTiK2023 2-1GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
(cid:27)
Click at the graphic
Start of GRAPHIC from the CMD environment (DOS box):
WINGRAF
or
WINGRAF project name.CDB
or
WINGRAF storage file,G
or
WINGRAF storage file.GRA
Asplashscreenappearsforsomeseconds,iftheprogramisstartedwithoutaparameter. This
splash screen is prevented with an input of any file name or the parameter /NOLOGO.
If the program is started without a data file, it asks for a file to be opened (.GRA) or for a data
base (.CDB). Otherwise GRAPHIC starts now with the indicated project name–data base.
In the last two cases GRAPHIC read the storage file and generates a drawing with the found
inputs. Theusercanselectandprocesssinglegraphics. Thenhecansaveitagainasmodified

2.3 Graphical Window
The graphical windows has the following classification for the processing:
– menu bar
– toolbar buttons
– dialogue area
– graphic area
– trees, e.g. result tree, layer tree, load case tree
– slider control for the text and representation height (unit)

The dialogue area at the lower picture border corresponds toa normal text screen. The inputs
of the user with the keyboard, error estimates and requests are represented here. In this case
the lines are shifted upward.
Thepositionofthepointerissymbolizedinthegraphicalwindowviatheso–calledcursor. The
form of the cursor can change according to the task. A pickbox is represented fundamentally,
if a point or a line should be picked.
2.4 Defaults
Subsequently the process of the GRAPHIC initialization is shown. In this case all settings are
defined for the next layer to be generated after the start of the program.
• Fixed values defined in the program are set directly after the start of the program.
• Then the environment variables (GRAFSIZE,...,GRAFD000...) are searched for in the sys-
tem environment or the file SOFISTIK.DEF. This environment variables are set, if they are
available.
• ThenapredefinitionfileWINGRAF.DEFissearchedfor. Thisfilecontainsthepredefinitions
as inputs in the CADINP format. The file WINGRAF.DEF is searched for according to the
following rules:
– first in the local working directory
2-4 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
– then in the SOFiSTiK path, in all directories which are defined in the SOFiSTiK environ-
ment variable
– then in the directory in which the program (WINGRAF.EXE) is
– If there are still no search results, the environment variables are evaluated in the order
of CDBASETMP and TEMP.
The file WINGRAF.DEF is stored manually, not automatically. This file contains the definitions
of the interactive buttons, which are saved with the help of the INTE records.
Furthermore the most important defaults can be defined in this file for a new graphic (SIZE,
SCHH,COLO...). Thesizeofthesaveddatacanbedefinedwiththecommandpredefinitions
of drawing in the menu options.
2.5 Input Possibilities
2.5.1 Cursor
If the left mouse button is pressed in the graphic area, the corresponding coordinates of the
picture plane are returned to GRAPHIC. The program changes to the keyboard, if a key on
the keyboard is pressed. If the ESC–key or the RETURN key are used, the keyboard mode is
interrupted or ended. It is changed to the mouse.
The cursor has a different look dependently on the commands:
target cross intersection of two short lines (a)
cross line intersection of two long lines (b)
rubber line linebetweenstartpointandthepointtobechosen(e.g. forcutting (c)
line definitions)
window rectangle at the diagonal between start point and the point to be (d)
chosen (e.g. for box and window definitions)
pickbox small box whose size shows the snap radius for the object snap (e)
(e.g. for point snap) If this representation type appears, the pro-
gram is in the pick mode.

(cid:64)
toolbar buttons at
the upper border

(cid:27) toolbar buttons
at the border of
the right–hand side
• Mouse button at the right–hand side (context menu), e.g.
• Tree structures (e.g. result tree, layer tree)
– A detailed description of the tree structure includes the subchapter: Trees.
The user can input the command name also via the keyboard (without the possible colon).
The command name can consist of up to eight alphabetic characters. The most important
commands are selectable also via the function key.
The repeating requests are completed correctly within the active command by selection of a
new command or the escape function. If a new command is selected within a request, e.g. of
significant parameters, the processing of this command is interrupted.
IfthetextCommand: standsinthetextarea,thepreviouscommandisended. ThenGRAPHIC
waits for a new command.
Important commands:
escape, esc
These commands interrupt compulsory a just current request of the program. They can
be used also for the regular termination of a request loop. This function can be also activated
via a pointer function.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-7GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
return
This command has some functions:
• It accepts a just current request of the program.
• It repeats the last request.
• It delivers the current position of the cursor to the program.
• It calls the reference point function which defines the coordinates relatively to a node.
2.5.3 Toolbars
The trees (layer tree, load case tree and database tree as well as the slider control, except for
the result tree) can be switched on like the toolbar buttons:
1. A list of the toolbars / trees / slider controls appears with a right–mouse–click at the
free grey border next to the toolbars. Switched on toolbars get a hooklet.
Figure2.4: Listofthetoolbars
2. in the menu options command options there is a list tool bars.
2-8 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
Figure2.5: ListofthetoolbarsinthemenuOptions
The trees can be arranged also outside the GRAPHIC window. If the STRG or CTRL key is
pressed during the shift, the tree is not docked (mostly) also in the nearness of the border.
2.5.4 Numerical Values
Frequently numerical values are necessary. These values are input via the keyboard in
GRAPHIC. In this case the request in the dialogue area can show the values proposed by
the program in peaked clips (e.g. < 0>). If the user has the same opinion, then he confirms it
withreturn. Otherwiseoneormorevaluescanbeinputseparatelywithcomma. Twocommas
following immediately or missing values do not change the corresponding value. The request
is repeated, if the values are no numbers or if too much numbers are input. Numerical values
has to be closed with RETURN of the keyboard (and not with the mouse button RETURN).
2.5.5 Texts
Texts are expected via the keyboard. If a standard text is planned, it is shown in peaked clips.
This text can be accepted with return, or a new text is input. The return key deletes the input
text and escape interrupts the request. The text input is ended automatically, if the maximum
number of the signs is reached. Also texts have to be closed with RETURN of the keyboard
(and not with the mouse button RETURN). Frequently also numbers are necessary within the
text inputs.
2.5.6 Coordinates
Thecursorcanbemovedtoanarbitrarypositioninthegraphicalwindow. Thecoordinatesare
deliveredfromthepictureplanetoGRAPHICwithaclickoftheleftmousebutton. Themissing
third coordinate results from the current representation specification.
The coordinates can be input also via the keyboard separately with comma. In this case the
coordinatescanbeoutsideofthescreen. IfnoZcoordinateisdefined,itiscalculatedfromthe
equation of the picture plane and the available coordinates.
GRAPHIC allows like the program AutoCAD also the definition of local screen coordinate sys-
tems as well as polar or relative coordinates.
The polarcoordinates are inputwith a < between thefirst value (radius)and thesecond value
(angle). The relative coordinates to the previous point are defined with a prepositioned @.
2.6 Menu File
The menu File contains the basic commands for the file management. Some commands of

In this way the content of the currently processed data file in the CADINP format, which is
shown in the WINDOWS title bar, can be saved. If no such data file is available, a file is
generatedintheCADINPformat. Thisnewfilecontainsallcurrentlyavailablegraphics,pictures
and layers with their current definitions.
Save as
The currently processed data file can be saved with another name.
Page Setup
In the menu point Page Setup it is possible to adapt the specific needs to the sheet head and
sheetsize. ThecurrentWINDOWSprinteristhedefaultfortheGRAPHICprinter. Itispossible
to choose another printer via Printer Setup. With the registry card there is the possibility to
definesettingsforinstancethesheetorientation,thesheetsizeorformatandthedrawingofa
border as well as the determination of its form. The options for the legend of the printout can
be changed in other registry cards.
Printer Setup
The printer can be selected and configured generally with the command Printer Setup.
Preview
The command Preview allows a preview of the sheets which should be printed.
Print
The command Print opens the standard dialogue window for the printing with WINDOWS.
2-10 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
Export graphic (.PLB)
The just processed data file is saved as SOFiSTiK metafile. Then this file can be considered,
stimulated, printed with the program REPORT BROWSER. On the other hand other graphic
formats (e.g. DXF) can be generated.
Export values list (.LST)
The values used for the representation are written as a list in a LST–file. The name results
from the current document or from the database name, if no document name exists yet. The
output can be limited to the current layer or the picture or the graphics in a dialogue box. Else
the values of all graphics are written. Then this file can be considered and printed with the
program WINTED.
The input which led to the values is recorded as a batch input (as for the GRA file) in the so
generated LST file. The lists can be formed differently. However, there is always a reference
number (in general the element number or the number set in an intern way) and at least one
resultvalue(1st value). Alsoa 2nd anda3rd value(forthemainreinforcement, thetransverse
reinforcement or for the support components in the X, Y and Z direction) is available for the
representation of some components (e.g. area reinforcement or support components). The
section value at the beam axis is printed in addition to the results at line elements. The global
insertion point or the group number is printed also for some results.
Export graphics formats (.DXF)
Thejustprocesseddatafile,thecurrentpicture,thecurrentpagewithallpicturesorthecurrent
selection in the layer tree is saved as a graphics format, as for example .DXF
Exit
The currently processed data file can be closed with Exit. If changes have occurred, the
program asks whether these changes should be saved.
If the termination occurs via the abort button , then no INI file is produced. That results
in the consequence, that WINDOWS specific user settings, for example switched on and off
toolbar buttons, the position of the tree windows, the size of the graphic area, are not saved
and do disappear therefore.
2.7 Menu Edit
ThemenuEditcontainsthebasiccommandsforthepicturemanagement. Somecommandsof
this menu are available also as toolbar buttons. Subsequently the commands are described:

SOFiSTiK2023 2-11GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
Occurred changes can be taken back command–wise and produced also again.
New Graphics , New Graphics with One Layer ,
New Graphics (empty) / Remove Graphics
In GRAPHIC it is possible to show a sequence of graphical representations of the calcu-
lation results separately. The current graphics is deleted from the total list with the menu point
Remove graphics. The command New graphics generates a new graphics after the current
graphicsandsavestheuptonowcurrentgraphics. Alwaysalllayersofthecurrentgraphicare
copied here. However, only one layer is copied always with New Graphics with One Layer.
A new graphic without any copy is generated with New Graphics (empty).
New Picture , New Picture with One Layer ,
New Picture (empty) / Remove Picture
Every graphics can contain some pictures. For this the user must choose the menu
point graphics Setup for View in the menu bar. In this menu point the number of the pictures
both in the height and in the width must have been defined. A new picture is generated with
the command New Picture. Then this new picture is set currently. The previous picture is
saved. Always all layers of the current picture are copied here. However, only one layer is
copiedalwayswithNewPicturewithOneLayer. Anewpicturewithoutanycopyisgenerated
with New Picture (empty). The command Remove Picture effects the deletion of the current
picture.
New Layer , New Layer (empty) / Remove Layer
The layer function allows the representation of different results or structures in a picture
on each other. This is especially useful for the comparison of the results. The user must
employ the command New Layer in order to define a new layer. In this case the old layer is
saved. A new layer without any copy is generated with New Layer (empty). The current layer
is deleted with the command Remove Layer.

input options are possible here:
=⇒ Group number
=⇒ Create cut
=⇒ 1m cut
=⇒ Multiple parallel cuts
=⇒ Delete cuts
With
=⇒ Group number
it is possible to allocate cuts, which should be generated, to an own group number.
Thus cuts with different directions can get for example different group numbers. Cuts can be
also deleted via their group number (see Delete cuts).
A straight cut or a cut as polygon can be generated via
=⇒ Create cut
The start point and the end point of the line are input interactively with the mouse or via
the keyboard. If the user wants to input the relative coordinates with the keyboard, a @ must
be input at first as in AutoCAD. Cuts with several segments (polygon) retain their direction.
The direction of single cuts is aligned.
With
=⇒ 1m cut
2-14 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
a cut is generated with a fixed defined length and direction. The insertion point in the
structure is always in the middle of the cut.
Several cuts parallelly to each other along a reference axis are defined with
=⇒ Multiple parallel cuts
Three possibilities of the input are available for this option.
1. Fixed default of the cut number and of the distance between the cuts
The cut number and the distance between the cuts are input via the keyboard. The 1st
cut and then the direction of the other cuts are defined in the structure with the cursor.

The cut number is input via the keyboard. Then a RETURN follows and the direction and
the distance to the last cut have to be shown.
The deletion of cuts can be done via
=⇒ Delete cuts
The selection of cuts in the active groups is done via an input in the dialogue area. The
input for each single cut is Y = Yes (deleting) or N = No (not deleting). The input for all cuts
is A. The selection is accepted with ENTER and is canceled with ESC. If only the cuts of a
specific group number are supposed to be selected, the group numbers of the remaining cuts
have to be switched off via the Group definition ..
2.7.3 Three–Dimensional Cuts through a Structure (SIR Cuts)
With the program SIR it is possible to generate three–dimensional cuts, at which resultant
beam forces are integrated, through a shell structure or a slab structure from finite elements.
An equivalent girder system at wich further checks can be done (e.g. in ultimate limit state) is
the result of that. The cuts are saved in the SOFiSTiK database. They can be evaluated then
with GRAPHIC. Especially the three–dimensional definition of the cut reference axis, the cut
properties, all integrated beam forces and after design of the equivalent beam cross section
also the relevant design and cross section values can be output graphically.
Furthermore there are possibilities in GRAPHIC to input interactively cuts and to modify their
properties. The modified or new cuts are saved in the database in order to determine the new
SOFiSTiK2023 2-15GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
internal forces and moments and cross section definitions with SIR.
The input and processing of SIR cuts is done via
Menu bar =⇒ Edit =⇒ SIR cut
Following input options are possible here:
=⇒ Properties of the next SIR cut
2-16 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
=⇒ Create a single SIR cut
=⇒ Multiple SIR cuts create via beam
=⇒ Delete SIR cut
=⇒ Save SIR cut to database
=⇒ Properties of all SIR cuts
At beginning of the processing the properties of the SIR cut which should be generate are
defined with
=⇒ Properties of the next SIR cut
A dialog box ”Properties of external beam section of the next input” is opened. The
geometry of the cut can be input in this dialog box. Appertaining to that:
– Kind of local direction
– Position of reference point along the cut–local Y axis
– Local Y coordinates of the active window of the section plane
– Position of the reference point along the cut–local Z axis
– Local Z coordinates of the active window of the section plane
– Depth of the section box for the support reactions
– in group (group number)
SOFiSTiK2023 2-17GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
Figure2.7: Sectionplane
The input of a single SIR cut can be done then with
=⇒ Create a single SIR cut
or the input of several SIR cuts in a continuous beam with
=⇒ Multiple SIR cuts create via beam
The start point and the end point of a single SIR cut or of a continuous beam axis for
several SIR cuts are input interactively with the mouse or via the keyboard. If the user wants
to input the relative coordinates with the keyboard, a @ must be input at first as in AutoCAD.
The SIR cuts can be deleted with
=⇒ Delete SIR cut
The inputs are saved in the database with
=⇒ Save SIR cut to database
Then they can be used for a calculation with the program SIR.
2-18 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
With the possibility
=⇒ Properties of all SIR cuts
the properties, as for example the position, the distances, the coordinates, the eccentricities,
the transformations and the cross section numbers, are shown.
Example: SIR Cuts at a Bridge
Initial situation
SOFiSTiK2023 2-19GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
The superstructure of a two–span curved T–beam bridge was input via structural areas
in SOFiPLUS. The superstructure which is represented via eccentrical placed area elements
(QUAD elements with position below) results after the mesh generation with the automatic
mesh generator.
HereanalternativeshouldbeshowntothecommonkindofrepresentationforT–beambridges
via a girder (exclusive BEAM elements) or via a combination of beams for the main girder and
area elements for the deck.
Thesuperstructureisgeneratedandcalculatedexclusivelywithareaelementsinordertorep-
resent very well the transverse structural behaviour also for skew bridges with very compact
main girders. For the determination of the internal forces of the main girder the program SIR
has the possibility for the user to get beam internal forces and moments, which refer to the
centroid axes of the section, at free defined sections via integration of the available plate in-
ternal forces and moments. The input of these beam section can be done very comfortable
interactiveinGRAPHIC.TherefromthecalculationcanbestarteddirectlywithSIR.Forthisthe
procedure is shown in the following example:

Tip:
Here it can be reasonable to not input the first and the last section directly onto the
edge of the bridge, because otherwise a ”cut off” cross section is generated due to
the curvature of the bridge.

Tip:
If not used SIR sections are available in the database, then it is possible to delete
these SIR sections and to release the cross section numbers during the calculation
of the SIR sections with the dialogue box.
Further calculation with the generated cross sections:
Because the cross sections generated by SIR are saved in the database and also
available in the CADINP format, the user has now all possibilities for a further pro-
cessingwiththeSOFiSTiKprograms. Thedesignofacrosssectiongeneratedbefore

In order to define now the reinforcement position which is necessary for the design
either it is possible to use the record LRF in AQUA or to input graphically interactive
the reinforcement with the program WinAQUA.

Figure2.16: Todefinethereinforcementposition
Note:
For rectangle cross sections it is possible to generate the more simple SREC cross
sections via the option: ”Generate SREC cross sections, if it is possible” during
calculation of the SIR cuts from GRAPHIC. For this purpose it is necessary, that the
reference axes are situated in the centre of gravity.
A design without an calculation of a static system can be done after the input of the
reinforcement distribution with the module AQB of the file project.sir. The internal
forces and moments of all calculated load cases are saved explicitly already here
(record S). For example it is possible here to do a design in ultimate limit state
for individual combinations from load case 1 (G) and load case 2 (Q). For this the
following two lines have to be inserted in AQB:

Only the differences to the first example should be shown in this example. Therefore
the details of the calculation procedure are not explained here.
A static system which includes only area elements was generated for a two–dimensional
tunnel calculation. The inner shell is also modelled with area elements. In order to get internal
forces and moments for the design it is possible to calculate interactive beam cross sections
with GRAPHIC and SIR.

line. If only a click is done at a point, no line is printed. If a line is drawn in the graphic, then
this line is printed too. The text is input in the dialogue area below. The size of the text can be
changed interactively before the end (after one return).
Insert text with frame
With the command Insert text with frame it is possible to insert in–line texts with and
without a line. If only a click is done at a point, no line is printed. If a line is drawn in the
graphic, then this line is printed too. The text is input in the dialogue area below. The size of
the text can be changed interactively before the end (after one return).
Insert position symbol
SOFiSTiK2023 2-33GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
With the command Insert position symbol it is possible to insert positions with and
without a line. If only a click is done at a point, no line is printed. If a line is drawn in the
graphic, then this line is printed too. The text for the position symbol is input in the dialogue
area below. The size of the position symbol can be changed interactively before the end (after
one return).
Insert level symbol
With the command Insert level symbol it is possible to insert level definitions with and
without a line. If only a click is done at a point, no line is printed. If a line is drawn in the
graphic, then this line is printed too. The text for the level symbol is input in the dialogue area
below. The size of the level symbol can be changed interactively before the end (after one
return).
Create axis
With the command Create axis it is possible to insert an axis definition. In the dialogue
area at first the position of the axis is demanded with From point and To point. The input for
this is done interactively with clicks. The text for the axis symbol is input in the dialogue area
below.
Multiple parallel axes
With the command Multiple parallel axes it is possible to insert simultaneously several
axes. At first the number and the distances between the axes are demanded in the dialogue
area. The input for this has to be done in the dialogue area. For the first axis the position is
defined interactively with clicks from From point to To point. It follows the interactive input for
the Direction of next axis. The text for the first axis is input in the dialogue area below. If a
number is defined for the first axis, then the other axes get the following numbers. If, however,
a character is input, then the following axes get the characters which follow in the alphabet.
Show axes outside SBOX
Axes are created with system coordinates. Therefore it is possible to check these axes
if they are outside the structure, when the BOX or GROUP selection are be changed. This
check can be switched on / off.
Create lines
WiththecommandCreatelinesitispossibletoinsertanarbitrarypolylineinthegraphic. The
input is done interactively with clicks from From point to To point.
Insert single dimensional line
It is possible to define a single dimensional line with this command. The default of the
text, the distance between the start and end point, is overwritten, if a text is input. The size of
the text can be changed interactively before the end (after one return).
Insert multiple dimensional lines

2.8 Menue View
The menu View contains the basic commands for the layout definition and for the view. Some
commands of this menu are available also as toolbar buttons. Subsequently the commands
are described:
graphics Setup
Settings for the scale, for the text in the head lines and for the legend are available with
the command graphics Setup.
Show Sheet Border
The sheet border can be switched on or off with this command.
Show Picture Partition
The picture partition lines can be switched off or on for the next picture or on for each
picture with the commands of this menue. Also it is possible to activate/deactivate the picture
partition lines for printing.
2D–Measurability
The representations drawn in GRAPHIC can be measured at the printed paper with the
rule. They are normalized to the paper plane (two–dimensional). The Z coordinate is used in
the representation of the three–dimensional view. If the last option (off) is used the represen-
tation direction is not changed even if the direction is equal to the base line direction, e.g. in
the case of representation direction = local x.
Coor.System On/Off
SOFiSTiK2023 2-35GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
This command switches on or off the indication of the global coordinate system.
View Definition
The point of view of the observer as well as the line of vision can be changed here. In
addition it is possible to select between the axonometric and perspective representation (see
also the record VIEW).
The user can find the input mask for x, y and z at Angle of axonometry in the dialogue box
Axonometry. Inthiscasethevaluesdescribetheangleofthecorrespondingaxistowardsthe
horizontal line of vision. The factors of the corresponding axes, the orientation axis and the
rotation angle may be input, if the option Scale definition was selected.
3D
The system may be rotated interactively via an extra window.
Default View
The representation of the basic system is the starting point for the perspective and the
axonometry. The order of the buttons corresponds to the order of the menu.
3D explicit
The position of the system in the three–dimensional area may be determined via an
input or via the selection of three points.
Perspective
The central perspective is determined via a centre of the projection in the picture plane,
via the distance between the observer point and the centre of projection and via the visual
angle. At first the fixed point in the picture plane has to be input and then the distance and the
acceptance angle (see also record PERS).

Switches
In that menu some useful switches are available, e.g. supports, kinematic constrains or
tendons symbols.
Switches are only offered with the respective context (e.g. If no kinematic constrains are
available in the system, the switch is grey)
Following Switches are available:
Support symbols
switches on or off all support symbols
kinematic constrains
switches on or off all kinematic constrains
Tendons
Alltendonsoftheplaneelements,beamsanddesignelementsareswitchedonor
off.
Truncated element lines
If only parts of the system are selected, the bordering switched off elements
are suggested (mostly grey) in order to show more clearly the correlation to the
remaining parts of the system (e.g. T–beam parts). This feature can be switched
on and off here.
Dimensions of columns, heads, splays
The dimensions of a column with head and splay may be storing at a structural
point. The drawing of these lines can be switched on and off here.
Text
switches on or off the result designation
Check text for overlapping
If the text is switched on, the check text for overlapping can be switched on or off
here. The check for text overlapping causes that the result designation remains
readable via omission of the smaller text for overlapping texts.

Decimal places
Here are the main used controls to changing the number of decimal places in the result
plot. The switch ’.D’ does set the number of decimal places in dependency of the size of
shownnumber. Asmallnumberwillhavemoredecimalplacesthanalargeone. Thereforethe
number of decimal places is variable for each shown number in the picture. All other switches
do set the same number of decimal places for each number in the plot. With switch ’.M’ is
used the number of decimal places set in the SOFISTIK units for the current unit (e.g. kN).
This is according to the table output of the other SOFiSTiK programs. ’.0’ means no decimal
places. ’.E’ is an exponential output for very small or very large numbers.
2.9 Menu Select
ThemenuSelectcontainsthecommandsfortheoutputofthegeneratedstructure,theloading,
the calculation and design results as well as for the cut definition and for the box and group
selection. Thecommandsofthismenuareavailablealsoastoolbarbuttons. Subsequentlythe
commands are described:
System Values
A selection, which elements should be represented with which system value, may be
found here. The prepresentation of the system values is possible after a generation with the
programs AQUA, SOFiMSHA, SOFiMSHC, PFAHL.
The settings for the designation of the picture may be defined in the edit sheet Text. Some
layers have to be defined for the simultaneous representation of some system values in one
picture. Itishelpfultousedifferentcoloursfordifferentsystemvalues. Thisdefinitionpossibility
is to be found also in the edit sheet Text.
Thematerialnumberorthescaleofalinerepresentationortheincrementofadesignationare
requested according to the type of the system value.
Further input possibilities are in the different edit sheets. For example the displaced structure
may be represented with Structure. In addition the modifications with regard to the repre-
sentation of the lines (e.g. structure edge, supported boundaries) and the used symbols, for
example supported nodes, may occur.
All important settings, like the value ranges, the colours and the position of the legend, are
possible in the designer of the fill pattern.
All graphical representations of the results in a line form can be adapted to the individual
demands of the user with the line designer (e.g. Only the values at the maximums and at the
2-38 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
beam ends can be plotted.)
In an analog mode options for the other representation types are available for the user.
Loads
Loads of a system may be plotted with this command. The desired load case can be
selected from a pulldown menu. The loads can be represented after a load generation with
the programs SOFiLOAD, ASE, STAR2, TALPA or DYNA.
Results
Here options which are able to visualize the internal forces and moments and the resul-
tant stresses in a simple and fast way are available. A result representation is possible after a
calculation with the programs ASE, STAR2, TALPA, DYNA or HYDRA.
For each element the user can find the corresponding result kinds and types. An appropriate
selection can occur with the help of the pulldown menu Load case and Representation. The
materialvaluesorthetimevaluescanbeplottedaccordingtotheresultkind. Veryremarkable
effects can be achieved often with variable colours.
Design Values
The calculated reinforcements and the design stresses as well as their combinations in
the separate design cases can be selected with the command Design Values. The design
values can be represented after a calculation with the programs BEMESS, AQB or STAR2.
Select previous LC
The previous load case of the current load case from the list of the load cases is set.
Select next LC
The following load case of the current load case from the list of the load cases is set.
Change_LC_Automatically
The load case may be changed if the current load case is invalid after a changing of re-
sult type. With the commands of that menue it is possible to control whether the load case is
not changed, whether the load case is changed automatically without inquiry or whether the
load case is changed after an inquiry.
Create Cut
Cuts through plane structures (QUAD elements) can be defined with the command Cre-
ate Cut. This is the same command as in the menu Edit–Cuts–Create Cut.
Show all
SOFiSTiK2023 2-39GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
Each selection is removed with the command Show all. All elements are be visible.
Selection manager
A selection includes all selections via box, group or single selection. A selection in-
cludes a view (line of vision) too. The properties of all defined selections can be edited with
the command Selection manager in a tabular form.
Define new selection
A new selection is defined with the with the command Define new selection. This se-
lection includes the current box, group and single selection in addition with the current line of
vision. Adescriptionoftheselectioncanbedefinedhere. Thisdescriptionisshowninthefirst
line of picture description.
Selection by Layer
Normally the selection is used for all layers of the current picture. But sometimes it
makes sense to use only the current layer, eg if the first layer shall include the whole structure
and the second layer shall have a selection of a result. After setting Selection by Layer the
next selections are used on the current layer till the command is be reseted again.
2.9.1 Boxes
Thismenuincludesthecommandsforgeometricselectionofelementsviathelocationoftheir
nodes.
Structure Limits
It is changed from the representation of the box to that of the overall system.
Box
A box of the overall system is defined via the selection with a window. Then only a box
is drawn.
When the box is drawn from left to right the selection of an element is valid if all nodes of this
element lie inside the box (window). This kind of box is marked by a continuous line.
When the box is drawn from right to left the selection of an element is valid if one node of this
element lies inside the box (cross). This kind of box is marked by a dashed line.
Change Box
Already defined boxes may be edited and new boxes may be defined simultaneously
with the command Change Box.
2.9.2 Groups
Thismenuincludesthecommandsforselectionofelementsviatheirgroupnumber(seeman-
ual for program SOFIMSHA/C, chapter ”GRUP”) .
All Groups
2-40 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
After the definition of a group selection all elements are represented with this command.
Define Groups
Individual elements or element types (e.g. beam elements, area elements) can be cho-
sen with the group selection for the representation. The group number of an element is equal
to the integer part of the term element number/group divisor.
Group divisor
Group divisor can be redefined temporary in GRAPHIC, if the elements were defined
with a fixed group divisor (divisor>0) during the system generation. Groups can be divided or
combined on this way.
But the better way is to define Secondary groups with program SOFIMSHA. These secondary
groups are available for the most programs, not only for GRAPHIC.
2.9.3 Nodes
This menu includes the commands for selection of specific node types.
Free nodes
Free nodes are not part of any element. Therefore group selection can not act on these
nodes. All free nodes can be switched on / off with this command.
Nodal sequences
Nodal sequences (EDGE) have no group number. Therefore group selection can not
act on these nodes. All nodal sequences can be switched on / off with this command.
BRIC inner nodes
Normally BRIC inner nodes are not visible. Only the nodes on the BRIC surface are
visible. All inner nodes can be switched on with this command so that all results (extremal
values) on this nodes are visible.
BRIC inner nodes
Sometimes invalid nodes are created during an invalid system generation. In this case
these nodes can be switched on here.
Domain
The nodes of a domain composition can be switched with this command.
2.9.4 BRIC surface
This menu includes the commands for visibility of BRIC surfaces.
Front sides
SOFiSTiK2023 2-41GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
The front sides are visible depending on the line of vision.
All sides
All BRIC outer sides are visible.
Group surfaces
Inner BRIC group border sides are visible too.
No surfaces
No BRIC surfaces are displayed. This makes sense if BRIC cut areas were defined.
Full structure
All BRIC elements are displayed, the inner ones too.
2.10 Menu Extras
The menu Extras contains the commands to change the units, the submenu Macros for the
additional informations and for the start of other SOFiSTiK programs (ANIMATOR, REPORT
BROWSER, TEDDY).
Distance
The distance between 2 points can be measured.
Distance in XYZ
The distance is output in the global components.
Angle 3 points
An angle between 3 three–dimensional points can be measured.
Menü Element info
A node or element may be searched via its number. Some properties, e.g. node coor-
dinates and node support, are shown additionally.
Start ANIMATOR
The interactive program ANIMATOR of the SOFiSTiK is started with the current database and
the current load case.
Start TEDDY
TEDDY is used for the text input (CADINP) of the SOFiSTiK statics programs. In addi-
tion different SOFiSTiK defaults can be defined there and some helpful tools can be used.
TEDDYisstartedwiththecurrentGRAPHICdocumentfile(.GRA).Ifthisfiledoenotexistyet,
2-42 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
the current statics input file (.DAT) is used.
Start REPORT BROWSER
REPORT BROWSER is used for the display or printing of SOFISTiK output. REPORT
BROWSER is started with the current output file (.PLB).
Start RESULTVIEWER
The interactive program RESULTVIEWER of the SOFiSTiK is started with the current
database. It is possible to create result lists and to create outputs of cross sections results.
2.10.1 Units
It is possible to change units and its precisions, layerwise too. if the unit system (UNIT SET)
is rearranged, changings of the former unit set will be erased during this action. Units is a
submenu of the menu Extras.
Change
Changing units and its precisions via a dialogue.
From default
Sets units of output to the default from file WINGRAF.DEF.
From database
Sets units of output to the units of current database.
Layerwise units
If this switch is on, changes of units are used only for the current layer. Otherwise the
changes are applied at all layer of the entire file.
Change database units
Overwrites the units of current database with the current units.
ATTENTION: The changed database units cannot be restored by command "undo".
UnitsInfo
Shows the names and settings of used units of the current layer in dialogue area.
2.10.2 Macros
Always recurring manipulations and settings can occur via the request of a CADINP–based
macro. Macros is a submenu of the menu Extras.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-43GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
Figure2.22: SubmenuMacros
Onlytheinputvaluesofthecurrentlayer,pictureorgraphicsarechangedwiththefirstdrawing
request (records STRU, NODE, BEAM or QUAD). If more drawing requests are defined, then
the layers arising newly are placed behind the current layer.
The submenu Macros contains the following commands:
Use
The macro selected via a dialogue box is used for the current layer.
Edit
The selected macro may be modified with the help of the program TEDDY.
Copy
The selected macro is copied into the clipboard. Then the use in the layer tree is possi-
ble (with the command Replace).
2.11 Menu Options
The menu Options contains transparent and non–transparent commands of general kind.
Transparent means that this command can be requested at any time even within a command
sequence. In this case the current menu does not have to be left or the command or the
command sequence do not have to be interrupted. Some of these commands are directly
accessible also in other menus.
2.11.1 Non–transparent Commands
Predefinitions
HerecanbedefinedtheamountofthepredefinitionstobestoredinthefileWINGRAF.DEFas
well as the definition, when these values are stored in an interactive session.
Auto–Redraw
If the Auto–Redraw is switched on the drawing of the current picture is repeated after
changing the input parameter. Also an automatic redraw is done from WINDOWS if the
window is changed. This behavior can take a long time at big systems. If the Auto–Redraw is
switched off the drawing is redrawn only if a explicit command (CTRL–N) is input.
Recalculate (CTRL–N)
The drawing of the current picture is calculated again. A new representations is forced
2-44 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
with this command.
2.11.2 Transparent Commands
Zoom
A picture window is determined with Zoom. The picture window may be changed also
within a request, because it is a transparent command. The desired window is selected via
two diagonal corner points.
The Zoom window is converted in system coordinates. The window ”displaces itself” with the
structureelementinthecaseofadisplacementofthezoomedstructureelementatthescreen,
e.g. in the case of the modification of the drawing scale.
Zoom bigger at point
In this way an area around a point to be clicked is increased in a defined step width.
Zoom bigger
An area of the picture is increased automatically in a defined step width with the com-
mand Zoom bigger.
Zoom smaller at point
In an analog mode to the command Zoom bigger at point only with minimization.
Zoom smaller
In an analog mode to the command Zoom bigger only with minimization.
Zoom before
The previous box is drawn again with Zoom before.
Zoom all
The overall picture is represented in the graphics borders with the command Zoom all.
Zoom borders
The overall picture is drawn with the definition Zoom borders.
Zoom pan
The current picture box is displaced over the structure. In this case the scale is main-
tained. The user is asked for a basis point and a displacement point via the dialogue area.
This may occur also with the scroll bar.
The user can arrange also the construction plane (picture plane) perpendicularly to the previ-
ousposition(usuallytheZcoordinate)inanewdistanceonlywithaninputofasinglenumerical
SOFiSTiK2023 2-45GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
value. Thereby the picture box is not changed. However, the input coordinates consider the
new position of this construction plane.
Coordinate system
The submenu Coordinate system contains the command local/global. This command
allows the change between the coordinate input in the local coordinate system and the input
withtheusercoordinates. Accordingtothemodethetext: localorglobalappearsinthestatus
line.
The coordinate input changes to the orthogonal mode with Ortho and returns. The text: ortho
appearsinthestatusline,ifthismodeisactive. However,onlytheamount–moderatelygreater
incrementisanalysedforthecoordinateinputwiththecursor. Orthoisparalleltothecrossline
axis. The ortho options is switched off temporarily, if this option is not wanted by the program
(e.g. for zoom).
Redraw
The drawing of the current picture is repeated or the graphics demanded from the mem-
oryisrepresentedforthefirsttime. GRAPHICdoesnotupdateimmediatelyeverymodification
of the parameters. A new representations is forced with this command.
Toggle cursor form
The WINDOWS standard cursor is changed first to a long cross. After the second com-
mand call the cursor has the form of a short cross. If the command is called for the third time,
the Windows standard cursor appears again.
Objectsnap
The there contained options set the defaults for the snap to none or to Single
Point . In the case of the default of the snap mode it is not urgently necessary that the
point lies really within the pick box. The simple numbers are interpreted as node numbers and
the number pairs or the triples as coordinates at Number .
Objectsnap temporary
The snap option Single Point is activated with the there contained command Single
Point. Then the cursor is the pick box. GRAPHIC determines the coordinates of the node
which was found within the pick box.
Options
The command Options contains specific options, that act program–comprehensively.
These are the colour palette selection of the printer, the memory interval in minutes, the
language of the surface and the text type for the status line.
2.12 Further Commands
Further commands for the input with the dialogue area which are not performed in the menus
2-46 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
are available.
default
All DEFAULT buttons in the individual input windows are defined as a default with the at
last read status of the defaults (mostly from the WINGRAF.DEF). The reservation of these
buttons may be changed here for the case, that it becomes necessary to use the initial
WinGRAF defaults.
tol
Different tolerances and limit values are available for the representation in GRAPHIC. It
can be useful to change the tolerances for specific structures and results.
WARNING: The user should change the value very cautious and with consideration only if
it is urgently necessary. Otherwise unexpected effects could arise during the
representation.
cleartyp
The default for texts is WINDOWS ’ClearType’ (including antialiasing). Normally such
text representation is better readable. But sometimes it leads to a ’greying’ effect of the texts.
It is possible to switch on / off the option ’ClearType’ via command ’cleartyp’.
2.13 Trees
For a better overview during the processing there is the possibility to use the trees which are

2.13.5 Representation
The representation kind can be modified fast with the tree ”Representation”.
The possibilities for Representation depend on the selected database values (result). Some
representations, for instance the isolines and isoareas, can be shown only for results in one
direction (e.g. principal reinforcement above) and not in several directions (e.g. reinforcement
above=principalandtransversereinforcementabove). Resultsforplaneandvolumeelements
can be available as values in the nodes, in the element centre point or in the Gauss points of
the element. A selection can be done here with this. Following representations are possible:
– Text
– Grid text
– Vector
– Grid vector
– Area representation
– Line representation
– Filled area
– Iso–Line
– Iso–Area

2.13.6 Layer
An overview of the generated graphics is shown in the folder ”Layer”. This overview includes
besidesthegraphicnumberingalsothepicturesandlayersfortherespectivegraphic. Thetitle
of a graphic or of a picture results from the content of the attached layers. The current layer,
the current picture, the current graphic are marked with coloured emphasized icons. The layer
icon shows here the type of the used representation.
The offered right–mouse–menu depends on the marking, whether a graphic, a picture, a layer
or several positions are marked.
For all case following right–mouse–menu is available:
Copy (only within the tree) CTRL+K
The marked elements are buffered, so that they can any often be duplicated in the
tree with the command Paste. All available layers are used during marking of a
picture (even if they themselves are not marked). All available pictures are used
during marking of a graphic.
Replace CTRL+H

without any changing of the other properties of these graphics, for instance the
kind of the shown result type.
Paste CTRL+V
This command is similar to Replace. The difference is here, that the available

2.14 How Does One Receive Pictures Fast?
Inthischapteritisexplainedhowtheusercanmakepictureswithdefaultsoronlyinsignificant
changes without large time required.
First the program start described in the subchapter: Start of the WINDOWS Version occurs.
For a fast generation of the structure pictures, the load pictures, the representation of the
internal forces and moments and the design results it is sufficient to work with the result tree.
Thecurrentdrawingmaybechangedwiththeselectionofaresultintheresulttree. Theresults
SOFiSTiK2023 2-65GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
are divided into 5 groups.
Figure2.23: Resulttreewiththe5representationgroups
2-66 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
• The System value group contains the structure, the most important information for the
materials and the cross sections as well as the numbering, e.g. element numbers, node
numbers and group numbers. (programs AQUA, SOFiMSHA, SOFiMSHC, SOFiPLUS)
Figure2.24: Structureofapointsupportedplate
SOFiSTiK2023 2-67GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
• The Load group shows the loads considered in the elements (programs SOFiLOAD, ASE,
STAR2, TALPA).
Figure2.25: Platewithdeadloadintheglobaldirections–loadcase1
2-68 SOFiSTiK2023WINDOWSVersion|GRAPHIC
• The Result group offers the internal forces and moments and the stresses determined
from the loads in the separate load cases as well as their superpositions (programs ASE,
STAR2, TALPA, MAXIMA, HYDRA).
Figure2.26: Principalmomentsofaplateduetothedeadload–loadcase1
SOFiSTiK2023 2-69GRAPHIC|WINDOWSVersion
• The reinforcements, the punching checks and the design stresses as well as their com-
binations in the separate design cases may be selected in the Design group (programs
BEMESS, AQB, STB).

3 Input and Output Description
3.1 Input Language
The input occurs in a free format with the CADINP input language (see the general manual
SOFiSTiK: ”Basics”).
3.2 Input Records
WING processes only a single input block which is finished with END. The input is analysed in
turn within this input block. In this case one must distinguish between attributes and drawing
orders. The most input records are attribute records. The values of this records are update.
However, their effects become visible only in the next drawing. If the literal DSGN is input for
TYPE in the drawing orders, only the attributes are set. Currently there are following drawing
orders:
STRU Plotofstructuralelements,systemvalues,inputitems,numberingaswellasdesig-
nations,deformedstructuresfordisplacements,eigenmodeshapesorstressareas
(stress peaks)
LOAD Plot of loads in vector form (e.g. single loads), in line representation (e.g. beam
line loads) or in area blocks (e.g. QUAD element loads)
NODE Plot of results in nodes (e.g. displacements, support reactions and boundary
forces) in vector form or as representation of numbers
QUAD Plot of a scalar variable (e.g. moment), vector (e.g. shear force or flow) or ten-
sor (e.g. principal stresses or reinforcements) for quadrilateral elements, special
feature for representation with numbers or fill patterns
BEAM Plot of a line representation for frame and girder systems (e.g. bending moments)
with numerical designation
ISOL Plot of isolines for QUAD elements
SECT Plot of results along cuts through the structure
BRIC Plot of results at volume elements
The plot of the structure is repeated as a contour for LOAD, NODE, QUAD, BEAM, ISOL,
SECT and BRIC. Plots are produced only for the record STRU and the records listed above,
whicharerequestedtheinformationaboutaloadcasestoredinthedatabase. Theotherinput
records are attribute records.
Each of these records produces usually an own drawing with the before defined attributes.
If the record AND is input between this records, the next information is drawn into the last
drawing. The option AND is deleted then again. The output of a deformed and undeformed
structure can be achieved therefore with following input:
STRU ; AND ; DEFO ...... ; STRU
Attribute are valid for all drawings until they are defined again. The records MOVE, DRAW,
TEXT etc. are valid as a common attribute of a drawing.
The sequence of the records is free. The attributes perform always only in the following draw-
ings.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-1GRAPHIC|InputandOutputDescription
The program WING uses the CADINP input language. The description can be found in the
general SOFiSTiK manual: ”Basics”.
The SOFiSTiK environment contains SET commands of the operating system and entries in
the file SOFISTIK.DEF. Some input records of the SOFiSTiK environment can be defined as
default values. These values have to be defined in the chapter ”[SOFiSTiK]” inside the file
SOFISTIK.DEF. The name of the environment parameter has eight characters beginning with
GRAF and following from the record. Then the value is a complete CADINP input line. The
following parameters are possible at this time:
GRAFKOPF
GRAFSTEU
GRAFSIZE
GRAFSCHR
GRAFFARB
GRAFFILL
The input language of these variables is usually derived from the language of the operating
system. If another language is used, this can be adjusted by GRAFKOPF:
GRAFKOPF=KOPF $ input language is german
GRAFKOPF=HEAD $ input language is english
It can be set for example (the default of paper size):
GRAFSIZE=SIZE 0 LP MARG NO
It is possible to set the default values of WING with GRAFSTEU. It should be input for using
the defaults not from the file WINGRAF.DEF:
GRAFSTEU=CTRL DEF VARI
Variables with the name ”GRAFDnnn” can be set for expanded defaults. For ”nnn” the char-
acters ”0”...”9” und ”A”...”Z” must be defined in the continuous sequence. That means that
the first variable is always ”GRAFD000”, then can follow: ”GRAFD001” ... ”GRAFD009”,
”GRAFD00A” ... ”GRAFD00Z”, ”GRAFD010” .... ”GRAFDZZZ”. The value is an arbitrary
input record in the CADINP format for WING (e.g. PAGE, GRP,...).
Theunitoftheoutputresultsisdeterminedinpartintheprogram. Someunitscanbeadapted,
however, also through the setting with the record UNIT in an user specific way (see general
manual: ”Basics”).

NOHE Line number in which the next HEAD line is 0
inserted
GSTR Default of the structure DEFA

CUT Cuts for area elements YES
WARN Warnings may be switched off -
REPR Correction of representation YES
EDGE Representation along EDGE YES
VAL Value of the option ∗ !
V2 Second value of the option ∗ -
The options have the following input possibilities:
NOHE Here a number line can be input in order not to delete previous HEAD lines. If for
example the ZTVK head should be changed, the user can continue with the 5th
HEAD line with the input CTRL NOHE 5.
GSTR The type of the (basic) structure with which the results are drawn is defined for
each result type. Mostly this is the complete structure for numbering (e.g. STRU
NUME ENO) else the contour. Then this basic structure is active, if the first layer
of a picture is used. All following layers do not get any structure in order to avoid
unnecessary time. The default of the result type can be influenced with an input
for GSTR:
DEFA uses the default of the result type
NO draws no basic structure as a default
CONT presets always the contour
FULL uses always the complete structure
MESH structural lines and points are drawn
AX uses structural axis
Usuallythestructureisdrawnfirst. Forsomerepresentations(forexamplefillareas

or isolines), however, it can be reasonable to draw the structure at last. This can
be achieved with the literals DEFE, CONE, FULE, MSHE or AXE.
IndependentlyofthatastructurecanbeassignedwithSTRUDSNGCONT,FULL,
MESH or AXIS to every layer, also a following layer. With STRU DSGN NO the
structure is not drawn.
DEF The input demands a specific level of the initialization of every value at the begin-
ning. This level can be input with CTRL DEF. It is reasonable to use the defaults
of GRAPHIC for a normal batch input. However, the current level can be retained
for macrowell-behaved inputs in the case of the interactive working. The complete
input is searched for CTRL DEF at the beginning of a batch run. The first input is
used. CTRL DEF is evaluated then no more during the actual processing of the
input. The following specifications are possible:
WING sets the GRAPHIC defaults
VARI uses the defined variables additionally to WING (GRAFSIZE, GRAF-
FARB and so on), if they are available
WDEF evaluates the file WINGRAF.DEF additionally to VARI, if it is available
CURR does not use the current values (only useful for the interactive working)
EMPT The input is checked for the validity of the results and element selection.
OFF Invalidsheets/pictures/layersarenotgenerated. Therearenowarnings
about this circumstance.
NO Invalid sheets/pictures/layers are not generated. Values are valid if they
are unequal to zero (default for batch processing in program WPS).
ZERO Invalid sheets/pictures/layers are not generated. Values are valid even
if they are equal to zero.
YES The pages/pictures/layers are generated, even if results are not avail-
able (default for interactive input in GRAPHIC).
REPR The input is checked for the validity of the representation.
OFF Invalid representations are not corrected. There are no warnings about
this circumstance. The subsequent program behavior is controlled with
’CTRL EMPT’.
NO Invalid representations are not corrected. A warning is triggered. The
subsequent program behavior is controlled with ’CTRL EMPT’.
YES Invalid representations are corrected (default).

picture plane, they remain three–dimensional, but not if the representa-
tion direction is equal to the base line direction
OFF three–dimensional representation, distributions are not projected in the
picture plane, even if the representation direction is equal to the base
line direction
AXIS Representation of axis lines

CUT Usage of cuts for area elements stored in the database (e.g. from program SOFi-
PLUS)
DEL stored cuts are deleted from database. After this the setting is changed
to NO.
NO stored cuts are not used (but not deleted)
YES stored cuts are used additionally to cuts generated with MOVE and

useless.
EDGE Uniting opposite (spring) directions during representation along EDGE.
NO Do not unite opposite (spring) directions.
YES Unite opposite (spring) directions of support springs only.
FULL Unite opposite (spring) directions of coupling springs also. The sign of
results can change.

The current database is closed and the new input database is opened with the input DB. Only
the reference number of the database has to be input in the case of previous definition of this
database with TITL.
It is possible to define ’SECT:no’ instead of a database name.
In this case WING is searched in the first database for a FEM database of cross section ’no’.
The current settings, .e.g. VIEW, GRP or BOX, are not changed (INIT NO). Thereby is it
possible to compare databases with similar systems directly. But in some cases, e.g. FEM
section, an initialization of input is useful (INIT YES).

In general, there are two variations to define the paper size:
• The user selects the paper format either implicitly using TYPE or explicitly by the width W
and the height H. The program can set the scale by itself, if it was not input. The largest
possible scale is selected with consideration of an engineering scale (1:1, 1:2 and 1:5 and
soon). Anexplicit settingofthe scaleSC willbe used, iftechnically feasible. SettingSC to
0 results in the largest possible drawing regardless of the scale.
• The user specifies the scale and by setting W and/or H to zero the appropriate paper size
is automatically chosen. If only one of the two values is set to zero, then the definition of
the scale can drop, because it is defined with the other dimension as above.

The dimensional lines of the picture coordinates are placed within the inner border below and

The grid scaling is the same as the one of the geometry.
Two selected coordinates can be dimensioned instead of the picture coordinates. This is rea-
sonable in the case of condensed diagrams. For this purpose the observer point of view must
be selected with the record VIEW in such a way, that the desired scale of reduction can be
achieved. The initial dimensioning can be retained with an input for SCAL. GRAPHIC decides
itself, which of the selected axes of coordinates should be placed horizontally and which one

The result description is placed at a corresponding background area. This area can be bor-
dered or the background can be deleted. The size of this area is controlled with BACX, BACY,
BMIN or BMAX. In this case X is the writing direction and Y is the direction of the height.

The distance of the descriptions from the insertion point is defined with FMVX, FMVY, MMIN
and MMAX. X and Y are here again the local writing directions.
Usually the insertion point is displaced relatively to its original position a little bit, so that the
descriptions in different direction (e.g. principal and transverse reinforcement of a plate) in the
same node do not overwrite themselves. In this case the direction and the maximum value
of the displacement (e.g. for QUAD elements the half element thickness) were determined
already with GRAPHIC. However, the user can still change this with DTYP, DVAR, DX, DY and
DZ.
The following inputs are possible for DTYP:
NO The insertion point is not displaced. The input for DVAR is not analysed.
CM DVAR defines the distance in cm. The inputs for DX, DY and DZ are
analysed.
DX, DY and DZ are not analysed for the following literals. A defaulted direction is used:
PROC DVAR defines the distance in % of the maximal allowable displacement.
FACT DVAR defines the distance as factor of the text height.
MINF as FACT, considering the maximum displacements
MAXC DVAR defines the distance in cm.
MINC as MAXC, considering the maximum displacements
DX, DY and DZ are only analysed in the case of DTYP CM. Otherwise the direction defaulted
by the program is used. The following literals are planned for DX:
X local x direction in the element
Y local y direction in the element
SOFiSTiK2023 3-25GRAPHIC|InputandOutputDescription

TITL Designation of the palette LT -
A palette can summarize all inputs for colours and/or fill patterns, so that a change is easier
and clearer within the input (for example for differentiation of a deformed and a undeformed
structure)
A palette can be defined via a reference number NO or via its name TITL. If NO is not input, a
previous palette TITL is searched. Then the corresponding reference number is set. If TITL is
not defined, the last reference number +1 is given to this palette. The last selected palette is
used, if neither NO or TITL is input.
The palette is defined with the actual values, if it is not available yet (the reference number
is not defined up to now) or COLO PUT is input. The saved values for FILL, VAL and ISOL
already available in a palette are overwritten, if YES is set. COLO is updated always.
Using this palette the values for COLO, FILL, VAL or ISOL which are indicated with YES are
set. That means all previous inputs for these records are overwritten.

The description of the colour and line types can be found in the general manual SOFiSTiK:
’Basics’. A negative line type (e.g. -1) does not represent the corresponding elements.
Results only with a specific sign can be represented with C13 and C14. C14 has to be set to
-1, if only tensile stresses are supposed to be represented (e.g. for diaphragm girders). If the
load cases 51 (Max–My) and 52 (Min–My) were stored from the program MAXIMA in the data
base, one receives so the envelope with following input:
LC51;COLOC131001C14-1;BEAMMY$ONLYPOSITIVEEXTREMEVALUES
AND
LC52;COLOC13-1C141001;BEAMMY$ONLYNEGATIVEEXTREMEVALUES
Group boundaries which are drawn with C15 arise in the case of adjoining elements with:
different group numbers
different material numbers
an existing crack in the element thickness
different local directions (transformation)

The tendon results are represented at the eccentric tendon, if the colour of the tendon C25
is defined. The results are placed at the lane of the tendon in the node plane of the QUAD
element, if the colour C25 is not defined (negative) and the colour of the lane C26 is defined
(positive).

A default number of base points exists for each fill type, to define the sequence of fill colours.
These base points were not used if NUMB is set to 0. Then is it possible to define owner base
points, without influence of the defaulted ones.
If the default values or colours for individual fill steps should be modified, this can be achieved
byusingthesubsequentrecords. TYPEisherethenumberofthefillstep(maximum255). The
numberofthefillstepsisincreasedaround1withoutaninputforTYPE.TheliteralsABOVand
BELO can be input for change of the colour definitions of the value ranges above the last step
or below the first step.
3-46 SOFiSTiK2023InputandOutputDescription|GRAPHIC
FROM and TO define the value range of a fill step. Irregular fill distributions can be achieved
with that. Single FROM – TO areas should be input in the ascending sequence of the fill
steps (from the smallest to the largest value). Intermediate values which were not defined are
interpolated. ThepropertiesofafillstepscanbechangedwithaninputofaliteralforMODE.
In this case the following literals have the meaning:
INSE Insertion of a value range FROM–TO
DELE Deletion of a value range FROM–TO
NFIX Deletion of the markers of a value range. The marked value ranges are
the supporting points in the case of an automatic interpolation of inter-
mediatevalues. Thentheyarenotchangedanymoreautomatically(e.g.
areas which were input with INSE)
TEXT Description of these isolines always
NTXT Description of these isolines never
The colour which should be used can be defined independently from the input for the value
range of a fill step (FROM, TO, MODE).
In this case the colour index which should be used is defined in the record COLO (0...14, ex-
planationofthesinglevaluesseeintherecordCOLO).Noinputofacolourindexisnecessary
forRGBcolours(isalways15). Anegativecolourindexdoesnotrepresentedthiscolourstep.
The type of the area filling is defined with INDX (it is described in the record COLB).
Inputs for the colour combination (values from 0.0 to 1.0) can be defined with RED, GREE
and BLUE in the case of the RGB colours. The RGB value is set according to its default, if a
negative input occurs for one of the three values. Then the RGB value is interpolated. One
gets a black representation, if all three values are defined with 0.0. An input of all three values
with1.0givesawhiterepresentation. Ifallthreevaluesareofthesamesize,thatshowsagrey

Additionally the RGB colours can be printed more brightly or more darkly in dependence on
the area orientation (item LIGH).
The undersides of the QUAD elements (in positive local z direction) and the inner sides of
BRIC surfaces are printed more darkly about the dimension of DARK with LIGH BELO. Inputs
for LIPX, LIPY and LIPZ are not used here.

LIGH POIN acts as LIGH DIFF. However, the distance between the areas and the light point
is considered additionally: The areas with the smallest distances to the light point are the
brightest ones. The respective light direction is determined from the direction of the area
centre of gravity to the light point.
LIGH DPOI acts similar as POIN. While the whole element area is illuminated uniformly, at
DPOI, however, the light shines at the element area in dependence on the distance.
LIGH BDIF acts as LIGH DIFF, however, only the dimension of the black–out or the flare is

the dimension DARK. At the light side they become more brightly about the dimension DARK
beginning at DARK. QUAD top sides and BRIC outer sides are not changed at the shadow
side, and they are printed more brightly about the dimension BRIG at the light side.
LIGH BPOI or BDPO act as LIGH BDIF, however, with additional properties which are de-
scribed at POIN or DPOI.
The default LIGH DEFA is for the isoareas BELO, for QUAD and BRIC load area POIN.
If the literal A is defined at the item DARK, The number of the fill colours is considered for
black–out and flare. The dimension is reduced for many colours in order to prevent not correct
colour representations.
The light direction results from the input at LIPX, LIPY and LPIZ. The light point is defined in
thesystemcoordinatewithaninputofanumberatLIPX.ForLIGHDIFFandBDIFtheuniform
light direction results from the direction of the light point to the system origin.
The light points which depends on the respective box of the current system section with ref-
erence to the screen are defined with the input of the literal SCRE at LIPX. The uniform light
direction results from the direction of the light point to the box centre for LIGH DIFF and BDIF.
For the definition of light points the input for LIPY is used as bit pattern as follows:
0 centre

+2 right screen border
+4 upper screen border

Thethree–dimensionalviewspecificationoftherepresentationisdescribedbyVIEW.Theinput
defines a parallel projection via the line of vision and orientation of the drawing at the sheet.
These input data are expanded for a possible perspective (record PERS).
Thedefaultoftheobserverpositionandtheorientationdependsonthegeometricalextensions
of the system. The view of the observer is placed in the direction of the coordinate axis with
the smallest dimensions. The axis with the largest dimension is based to the right–hand side
for plane systems. The z axis is based downwards in case of three–dimensional systems with
a significant extension in z direction.
The user has the following possibilities for the representation and orientation of the structure
at the sheet:
1. TYPE = DIRE or STAN
The values X, Y and Z are components of the direction in which the observer looks. The
observerstandsintheinfinitedistanceincaseofparallelprojection. ThusX,YandZarecoor-
dinates of a point which lies from the observer directly behind (DIRE) or in front of (STAN) the
origin of the coordinate system. The value of AXIS defines the axis which shows downwards
for the observer.
Figure3.5: Lineofvisionorobserverstandpoint
2. TYPE = ANGL
The three inputs for X, Y and Z describe the angles x,y,z of the corresponding axes towards
the horizontal direction. The three values can be selected arbitrarily. However, attention is to
be paid, that the graphical representation can be degenerate with an input of two orientations
standing vertically to each other or parallelly. These degenerations describe either an axis
vertical to the optical plane or a no unambiguously defined illustration.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-61GRAPHIC|InputandOutputDescription
Figure3.6: Axonometryangle(x=+30,y=-30,z=-90)
3. TYPE = SCAL
VIEW can be used to generate a desired reduction of the axes, e.g. for condensed diagrams.
The reductions of the three axes correspond to following equation for every axonometry:
r2 + r2 + r2 = 2
 y z
Figure3.7: Axonometry
The above figure shows the determination of the reduction scale ry for the Y axis. GRAPHIC
interprets the inputs of the reductions to x, y and z according to following rules: If three values
are given, they get scaled and the corresponding representation is constructed. Here the
following convention is arranged, that positive values for x, y and z mean a orientation of the
corresponding axis away from the observer. On the other hand negative values mean an
orientation of the axis to the observer.
If only two values are input, so these are normalized first with the larger one (1:4 is the same
3-62 SOFiSTiK2023InputandOutputDescription|GRAPHIC
as 0.25:1). Then the third value is determined with the quadratic normalization. In this way
condensed diagrams can be defined. The input "x 1 y 4" reduces the x axis to a quarter of
the y axis. It is the same as a fourfold magnified y axis. In this case the scale of the drawing
always refers to the undistorted axis (here y axis).
4. TYPE = TRAN
The 3x3 transformation matrix including possible distortions can be defined also directly with
VIEW. In this case the 1st line (POSX, NEGX), the 2nd line (POSY, NEGY) or the 3rd line (all
other AXIS literals) can be selected via AXIS. The 1st, 2nd or 3rd matrix column is filled or the
available matrix is changed at this position.
5. TYPE = YZ, ZX, XY, –ZY, –XZ, –YX, ZY, XZ, YX, –YZ, –ZX, –XY
If an element type is defined with item X, the local element transformation of the element
defined with item Y is used instead of the global transformation. For example the input VIEW
XY QUAD 3 is effecting, that the vision of line is equal to the element normalization vector of
element 3. With a negative input to item Y the nth element is used.

The defaulted parallel projection is length- and angle-precise with attention of all three co-
ordinates. Therefore it is suitable for a three-dimensional representation including all results
without limit. However, a projection, the central perspective, is wanted sometimes, which is
moreadequatetothehumaneye. Inthiscase,however,therepresentationoftheresultsisre-
duced, because for example perspective deformations arise for the representation of moment
diagrams.
1. Central Perspective
The central perspective is defined with a observer standpoint (camera) in a finite area, a
projection centre in the optical plane (focal point) and a visual angle.
The horizontal and vertical position of the observer due to his standpoint in the infinity is irrel-
evant for the parallel projection. On the other hand the observer moves to a finite distance to
theobjectforaperspectiverepresentation. Thereforenotonlyhisdistancebutalsohisrelative
position to the object are important. The line of vision was defined in record VIEW.

Figure3.8: Centralperspective
Focal point
The focal point is the point which lies both in the optical plane and in the optical axis of
the illustration. The focal point can be used also for the depth of focus of a parallel projection.
The illustration is length- and angle-precise in the focal point.
Observer point
The observer is the point at the optical axis with a distance A from the focal point. The
vector focal point to observer point has the absolute value A and the direction defined with the
record VIEW.
Visual angle
The observer can see principally only the things in his line of vision in case of the per-
spective representation. A visual angle must be introduced because the points which are
exactly next to the observer are projected to the infinity. The observer can see only points
whichlietotheopticalaxiswithinatangentialanglewhichissmallerthanANGL.Thefollowing
table describes values for ANGL in the comparison to the lens focal length of a miniature
camera:
0.643 correspond to 28 mm (wide angle)
0.360 correspond to 50 mm (normal)
0.144 correspond to 125 mm (tele)
2. Cylinder Projection
One can receive a very special illustration if the literal CYL is defined for ANGL. Then
the optical plane is the developed view of a cylinder with a vertical axis which contains the
focal point at the cylinder surface. The radius of the cylinder is A. Thus the observer stands at
the axis of the cylinder.

All lines are represented normally including hidden lines which lie behind a QUAD or BRIC

omits all BRIC areas which lie behind the observer.
However,itispossiblenottodrawpartsofthesystemforallrepresentations,alsoforperspec-
tive or parallel projections. For this two variants are possible.
1st Hidden lines
The representation of hidden lines can be prevented in case of three–dimensional plots.
For this purpose two methods whose CPU time increases for the refined representation
possibilities are available.
1st NODE
Themethodexaminesallnodes,whethertheyarecoveredfromareas. Thenonlythese
elements or their results are drawn whose nodes are visible. This method is very fast.
However, it can not realize partial not visible or hidden lines.
2nd LINE
This method is the classical hidden–line method. It can not distinguish, whether an
element area is covered, because it works edge related. Therefore the results are
represented in all elements which are visible according to the first method.
2nd Depth of the focus
The represented area behind (DMAX) and in front of the optical plane (DMIN) can be
limited in the direction of the observer for all representations. The default for DMAX is +1.E12.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-67GRAPHIC|InputandOutputDescription
The default for DMIN is equal to the negative distance of the observer from the picture point
for perspective representation. In the case of parallel projection it is -1.E12.

By using DEFO a deformed structure is represented in all following drawings instead of the
original structure. The coordinates of the deformed structure are generated from the unde-
formed structure with the addition of a scaled offset for shift rule.
The following possibilities are implemented for the scaled offset for shift rule:
1st Deformations
Thedisplacementsofthecorrespondingloadcaseoroftheeigenmodeshapeare
addedwiththeinputofanumber. IftheliteralYESisindicated,thedisplacements
of the load case defined with LC are used.
2nd Potential from an analysis with the program HYDRA
With the input of the literal POT the potential values of the state defined with the
record LC are used for the representation instead of the z coordinates. A free
surface through the BRIC structure can be generated by using the literal FREE,
if results are calculated in BRIC elements. A hole will appear at these places
where the free surface is intersecting the BRIC surface. The surface nodes are
displaced at these nodes according to the potential with the literal FRGL.
3rd Internal forces and moments for plates and shells
Thecorrespondinginternalforcesandmomentsofthenodesinthenormalnodal
direction (local z axis) are added with an input of the literals MXX, MYY, MXY,
VXX, VYY or NXX, NYY, NXY. Then the record STRU draws the areas of internal
forces and moments.
No representation occurs only with an input of the record DEFO. One of the drawing records
(e.g. record STRU) must be given always after DEFO. The representation of results for de-
formed structures may be limited.
The load case, the magnification and the frequency for eigenvalues are printed in the legend.
No deformed structure is represented with DEFO NO.
With the input DEFO GAR or GARB it is possible to define a projection of a structural area
3-70 SOFiSTiK2023InputandOutputDescription|GRAPHIC
defined via FAKV. A positive input of FAKV is not changed the current selection defined with
SEL and BOX. DEFO GAR and a negative FAKV set a single selection like SEL including all
QUAD elements belonging to this area. DEFO GARB creates a surrounding BOX. Inputs for
SEL and BOX, defined before DEFO, will overwritten.
With the input DEFO GVO or GVOB it is possible to define a 3D view of a structural volume
defined via FAKV. A positive input of FAKV is not changed the current selection defined with
SEL and BOX. DEFO GVO and a negative FAKV set a single selection like SEL including all
BRIC elements belonging to this volume. DEFO GVOB creates a surrounding BOX. Inputs for
SEL and BOX, defined before DEFO, will overwritten.
With an input for SMOV a system movement load case is used (e.g. incremental launching of
bridges). Then the displacements of this load case are added to the node coordinates. When
using CURR the current load case is determined by this following order:
1st Load case of deformed structure
2nd Load case of current load or result
3rd Load case of group control depending on a load case

The beginning of the continuous beam with the ordinate XS=0.0 is generated with the record
MOVE. All following records DRAW define the polygon points of the continuous beam. Here
thebeamordinateXSiscalculatedautomaticallyfromthedistancebetweenthepoints. These
pointsarethereferencepointsofthesection(intheprogramSIRrecordSECTitemsXM,YM,

defined in the record VIEW. The kind of the local direction is selectable with the item LDIR (
default: Y if it is a disc or framework ; otherwise Z ). With the record DSIR the properties of
the last defined point are changed or the properties of the next point are defined. The local x
direction is generated from the continuous beam direction, if the items NX, NY or NZ are not

LC For the cutting pattern calculation a stress load case − DEFO LC
which should be considered can be input, as long as
no load case is defined for the deformed structure.
0 Unstressed initial state
Cuttingpatternareasare generatedwithconsiderationofthemateriallimits, thesuddenthick-
ness changes and the areas which have a T–shape. They are saved in the database. Old
saved cutting pattern areas are deleted here. The generated areas can represented with the
record STRU CUT FILL YES.
Cutting pattern areas are sorted via the numbering of QUAD elements. So the cutting pattern
area numbering can be influenced through a clever arrangement of the first QUAD element
numbers in the original system, ie one per cutting pattern.

Some results show values in different (a maximum of 3) directions. If not all directions should
be represented, the item DIRE can be used for the selection.
A comparision of results of a calculation or of a design is possible with item KIND if the values
are real numbers. KIND is not available for system values, loads and texts. The comparision
requires two load cases or design cases. The second LC record should include the KIND
specification. The global direction components are used for calculated comparisons (addition,
difference, multiplication) of values with directions (e.g. difference of the node displacement
vectors). Therefore for the multiplication the scalar product of this vector is used. For the
division (quotient) always the value is used. The new direction is calculated from the normed
scalar product.

The length of the representation depends on the result size and the input unit of the repre-
sentation records. A maximum length can be defined with LMAX in order prevented that large
representations reach over the picture edge in the case of very different values. The rep-
resentation is marked at such points with an other line type LFRB. A minimum value of the
length LMIN can be input in order to make also very small representations more clearly. All
representations get exactly this uniform length, if LENG is defined.

SOFiSTiK2023 3-95GRAPHIC|InputandOutputDescription
The kind of the load arrows at the corners of the representation is defined here in the case of
area representations.
Useful defaults for the arrow head representation (e.g. double arrow for moments) exist for
each result type. However, an other representation can be defined with KIND as well as KIN3
and KIN3. The definition occurs via a literal with four alphabetic characters. In this case the
sequence of the alphabetic characters is decisive. Not used alphabetic characters should be
marked with an underscore character ”_”.
1st alphabetic charcter, kind of arrow head:
_ no arrow head
I transverse line
O open arrow
P closed arrow
Q filled arrow
J transverse line half–page at the left–hand side
L open arrow half–page at the left–hand side
M closed arrow half–page at the left–hand side
N filled arrow half–page at the left–hand side
K transverse line half–page at the right–hand side
R open arrow half–page at the right–hand side
S closed arrow half–page at the right–hand side
T filled arrow half–page at the right–hand side
2nd alphabetic character, multiple head:
_ single arrow head
2 double arrow head
3 threefold arrow head
4 fourfold arrow head
3rd alphabetic character, additional transverse lines:

1 1 transverse line behind the arrow head
2 2 transverse lines behind the arrow head
3 3 transverse lines behind the arrow head
E 1 transverse line at the vector end
F 2 transverse lines at the vector end
G 3 transverse lines at the vector end
H 4 transverse lines at the vector end
4th alphabetic character, bit pattern for the other properties:
0....9 bit pattern values 0....9
A....Z bit pattern values 10...37

In the case of single vectors (TYPE SING) in the top view it is changed to another represen-
tation at which one would see otherwise only a point. With UKIN, UKI2 and UKI3 a changed
KIND input can be complemented with respect to the top view. The definition occurs via a
literalwiththreealphabeticcharacters. Herethesequenceofthealphabeticcharactersisalso
decisive. Notusedalphabeticcharactersshouldbemarkedwithanunderscorecharacter”_”.

_ single symbol
2 double symbol
3 threefold symbol
3rd alphabetic character, filling:
_ not filled
F filled, if polygon, square or lozenge symbol were defined
For line representations (TYPE LINE) one can define with FKIN whether the representation
should be filled with direction arrows. Only for loads the representation is filled as a default.
The definition occurs via a literal with four alphabetic characters. The following alphabetic
characters are possible:
C complete arrows, that is drawing with the arrowtail
T drawing of some arrow heads in the distance FDIL in a lozenge form along
the arrowtail in the case of larger representations
S Additionally to T: distance at the beginning (offset for shift rule), considera-
tion of FDIS for some arrow heads in the representation
H also if only the half vector distance is available print the arrow heads in the
representation nevertheless
L The arrows will be placed on the middle of the line, if the result value direc-
tion is parallel to the direction of the line or, in the case of 2D view, parallel
to the view direction. In this case the representation will not be shown. If L

Thecontoursofthecrosssectionscanberepresentedforbeamelementsinsteadofthecross
sectionnumbers,ifthecrosssectionwasinputwithitsgeometryintheprogramAQUA.Usually
the cross sections are drawn in the same scale as the system. However, an additional factor
can be defined with FACS.
The local twisting TWAR is definition–dependent: In GRAPHIC is calculated a incline. The
local twisting is the difference between maximum and minimum eccentricity of nodes to this
incline. A defined deformed structure will considered.
The material parameter of faults are displayed in direction of meridian angle in case of QUAD
elements. In case of BRIC surfaces fault plane is calculated from meridian angle and descent
angle. Then intersection line between faults plane and BRICs surface is generated. The
material parameter are displayed in direction of this line.
Beam hinges BEAL are shown in the form ’h,n:i’. ’h’ means the ’normal’ hinges. ’n’ is the
number of a work law. ’i’ means the implicit beam hinges.
The inverse shear resistances WT, WVY, WVZ, WT2 are used for the shear stress calculation.
Defined points in the cross section may have a shear stress equal to zero. At these points
the shear resistance is infinite. But the calculation with infinite values is difficult. Therefore the
calculation uses the inverse values ( τ=V·A ners =V·WV ).
Theforegroundandthebackgroundofthedesignationcanberepresentedincolour. Theinput
occurs with a literal combination for the item SCHH. The filling of the background area deletes
the representations in this area. The size of this area is defined via the items BACX, BACY,
BMIN and BMAX in the record SCH2.
Colour of the foreground:
FU a colour from the record COLO (default for FILL NO for numbering)
FS different colours for positive and negative values from the record COLO
(default for FILL NO)

(default for FILL NO), not possible, if FS is set
BI variable value–independent colours from the record FILL (default for FILL

Determination of the Contour
All QUAD and BRIC element edges with a common support in the start and end point are
represented as a supported edge with the line types from the records COLO or COL2 in the
drawing.
A combination of the inputs for BCON and WCON defines, which element edges of the plane
and volume elements generate the contour, that is which one of these edges has not to be
drawn. An input for BCON can define, which element type that does not fulfil the criteria of
WCON (in this case it can be omitted) also in fact is extinguished then. The following literals
are possible:

Types(TYPE)DL,DLX,DLYundDLZareusedforvisualizationofthedeadloadfactors. They
are calculated with the program ASE.
With the item GTYP the different processing stages of loads are selectable.
With GTYP ELEM the really used loads are shown, therefore the loads which are related
to elements or nodes. The element types (ETYP) FREE, POIN, LINE and AREA are used
(exclusive) for visualization of the free loads projecting on QUAD–elements.
WithGTYP INPtheuser–definedloads (”inputloads”)are shown. Localelementdirections in
thefreeloadscannotbeshowncorrectly,becauseitisnotclearwhichelements(withdifferent
directions) the loads will find. Therefore these loads have no load arrows.
Thetotalload,generatedonnodes,arevisiblewithGTYPLVEC.Theseloadsareusedforthe
Finite Element calculation.
Note for the LOAD output
The representation of free, point and line loads (except for LIN PLAN or PLAP) occurs
always in the load direction. Element area loads (ELLO) are drawn perpendicular to the
elementsurface. Theloadrepresentationoffreeloads(e.g. BLLO)occursalwaysintheglobal
directions (also for input of the local element directions).
The necessary designation in the legend can have a great extent. Therefore the legend is
drawn in an insertion point (zero point lies below at the left–hand side), if it is defined with
LEGX, LEGY. The legend is positioned at the right border or above, if STAN is input instead of
LEGX or LEGY.
The loads (if they overlap in the representation) are displaced in the opposite load direction in
case of the turned on verification algorithm (in record SCHH REVI) and the input SEPA YES.

Three–dimensional representations are usually necessary for systems of the type GIRD in
order to recognize the corresponding vectors of the forces PZ.
Therepresentationofboundaryforcesoccursalongtheboundarywithstatuslineswhichshow
into the component direction. Another direction can also be selected with the item DTYP.
The forces in local directions which are available in the boundary direction (direction N, from
node A to node B) or perpendicularly to it (directions S and T) may be represented for curved
or skew boundaries in three–dimensional systems. Here the direction T of the first boundary
partisalignedtothelocalzdirection(normaldirection)ofthefirstfoundQUADelementwhich
lies at this node. The directions can be checked with STRU COOR, COOX, COOY, COOZ
BOUN.
Usually irregular distributions of the boundary forces (EDGE,...,EM) are a result of the FE
analysis. If a regular distribution is necessary for a further calculation (e.g. for wall loads), this
can be represented with the literals EXD, EYD, EZD, END, ESD, ETD or EMD or via the input
TOTA TRAP for the types EX, EY, EZ, EN, ES, ET or EM.
Average Line Representations and Resultants
The calculation of a regular line distribution or their resultant occurs with these conditions:
• The total sum of the line representation must be unequal to 0.
• The line representation must associate.
• The direction of the basic line of the line representation may not change essentially (Oth-
erwise the components which act in different directions are added in the case of the mo-
ments.)
Then GRAPHIC determines a linearly variable distribution (trapezium) whose sum and centre
of gravity is equal to the initial values.
Instead of the line representation the sum of this and the position of the centre of gravity can
be printed with the input of TOTA PAIR or GENE. GRAPHIC shows a line from the total to the
line. The length depends on the vertical distance of texts (offset) (record SCH2 FMVY).
Representation at nodal sequences (REPR DEDG)
Certain single nodal forces, forces at kinematic constraints or spring forces can be dis-
tributedalonganodalsequence(EDGE)similiartotheboundaryforces. Eachconnectingline
between two nodes is used exactly once, even if more than one nodal sequence was defined
at this line. Only forces with the same direction are be summarized.

to the ratio M/W for the external fibres which were determined by the program AQB. On the
other hand SIGD and SIGZ are minimum and maximum stresses in the total cross section.
The normal stresses for truss elements and cables are represented with SIGU.
The bond force BOND is calculated from the difference of longitudinal forces per material be-
tweenthebeamsections. Ifmorethanonematerialexiststhetotalcanbecalculated(LCMAT

In this cases the geometric scale is the default for UNIT.
Representation
Logical defaults are prescribed for the representation directions of all values. The usual
values are represented along the local y or z axis. Influence lines are drawn with their
componentsintheglobalcoordinatedirections. Inspecialcases(forexamplethelineofvision
is equal to a local axis, but also for moment diagram in USA) all other types of representation
can be selected by using DTYP.
The values are represented always with their real dimension also in the skew directions.
Additional designations are represented at the status lines, if SCHH is not zero. The amount
of the designations can be controlled with STAT. No designations occur, if the distance of the
beam sections becomes smaller than the text height and the check of the text is not activated
(record SCHH REVI).
Beam moments
If shear forces (derivatives of moments) are known in beam sections, a cubic parabola
is drawn to create an engineering line. In this case maximum values may be calculated.
The user has to check these maximum values if the loads include line moments, because
high-order moment lines are generated then. Or more nodes or beam sections have to be
defined. A warning is printed.
Attention: These (maximum) values are generated internally in GRAPHIC/WING. They are
not saved in the database and are not provided for superpositioning and design calculation.
Beam displacements
If rotations (derivatives of displacements) are known in beam sections, a cubic parabola
is drawn to create an engineering line. In this case maximum values may be calculated. The
user has to check these maximum values because these cubic parabola results from the
displacements formulation of Finite Elements Method (solution of minimum of deformations
energy) and each loading (e.g. line loads) requires a high-order line. Or more nodes or beam
sections have to be defined. A warning is printed.
Attention: These (maximum) values are generated internally in GRAPHIC/WING. They are
not saved in the database and are not provided for superpositioning and design calculation.
Beam loading
The loading is represented with its defined distribution considering the load factors, the
gravity loading, the moments due to the eccentric loading and the generated loads.
Point loads are drawn as vectors with UNI2.
Composite cross sections
A material number (record LC MAT) for SIGU to SIGV must be specified for composite
cross sections. The results can be saved in the database also with a stress point defined in
the program AQUA. Then the designation (literal) of this stress point can be input for MAT.

Internal forces and moments
The internal forces and moments of inherent stresses of the cross section from creep
and shrinkage are added to the internal forces and moments N...MT1, if they are available in
this load case.

Element type (STYP):
The quadrilateral elements in SOFiSTiK includes five Gauss points. Four points are located
near the corners and one point in the middle of element.
The point in the middle corresponds to the value ’Centre of QUAD elements’ (STYP QUAD).
For some non-linear results, it is possible to printout with ’Gauss points’ (STYP GAUS) the
values of the four Gauss points which are located near the corners.
In order to get a smoothed distribution of these values of the four Gauss points which are lo-
cated near the corners, WING is able to calculate an averaged value of all Gauss points in the
node which is important for cuts or isolines. This value is called ’Averaging node values, read
from Gauss points’ (STYP G2N).
The programs for the analysis (eg. ASE) calculate the nodal values using an extrapolation of
the values of the four Gauss points into the nodes and average them about all adjacent ele-
ments. In WING it is value ’Nodes of QUAD elements’ (STYP NODE).
Sometimes the programs do not determine values in the nodes, e.g. in the case of a superpo-
sitiononlyfor’ETYPQUAD’inprogramMAXIMAandmissinginput’ETYPQNOD’forvaluesin
thenodesalthoughthesenodalvaluesarenecessaryforthegraphicalpresentationofisolines
or cuts. In such cases it makes sense to calculate temporarily the nodal values of the ’Centre
of QUAD elements’ by shifting the value of the centre into the nodes. Subsequently, this value
SOFiSTiK2023 3-171GRAPHIC|InputandOutputDescription
is averaged about all adjacent elements. This value is called ’Averaging node values, read
from element centre’ (STYP E2N).
Theprogramsoftheanalysisareabletocalculateerrorestimatesinthecentreoftheelements.
These values are the ’Error estimates in centre’ (STYP ERIN).
However, since no error estimates are calculated in the nodes by the programs during analy-
sis, WING can determine them similarly to the STYP E2N. This corresponds to the ’averaging
node values, read from error estimates’ (STYP EE2N).
The volume elements are correspondingly used, however, they can have up to eight Gauss
points.
The point in the middle of the volume element corresponds to the value ’Centre of BRIC ele-
ments’ (STYP BRIC).
ThenodalvaluesoftheBRICelementswhicharecalculatedwiththeprogramsoftheanalysis
are output with ’Nodes of BRIC elements’ (STYP BRIK).
Representation as Tensor / Vector (REPR DVEC,DARE,DREP,DTXT):
• A line in the corresponding length is drawn in its real size in the two projected directions
(see record VIEW) for HM, HN, HS, BM, NS, N, HSU, HSL, EPSU, EPSL, SIIU, SIIL, S2U,
S2L,WU,WL,WRU,WRLaswellasASL,ASU.Negativevaluesgetshortlimitlinesforthe
differentiation. The value is measurable as long as the effect direction is not perpendicular
to the drawing sheet.
• The vector of the flow velocities is drawn in its projected direction for FL, PA and Q.
• Allother(single)valuesaredrawnintheireffectivedirection. Alsoisolines,cutsandfillarea
are possible here.
• An error estimate can be printed with STYP ERIN for HM, MX, MY, MXY, BV, VX, VY, HN,
NX, NY, NS, SX, SY, SZ, TXY and OPTG, if it was requested for the calculation.
Thepunchingresults(TYPEPUNC,ASPS)usethecolourC14(recordCOLO)forthetext,the
colour C4 for the drawing of the column cross section or the enlarged column head and the
colour C13 for the punching circle. An input for a minimum value (record SCH2 item MIN1)
which should be represented is compared with the support reaction.
Representation at Isolines (REPR DISO)
The isolines are calculated one element at a time from the nodal values and drawn.
The isolines are defined within each element with a hyperbola. The lines are straight, if the
part of the hyperbola is small.
The designation of the isolines occurs in such a way that the text is readable so called uphill.
A designation must be input explicitly with SCHH, if more than 50 isoline values are active.
The isolines may be designated in intervals (DTXT). GRAPHIC searches for favourable posi-
tions within subareas whose size has to be defined via CDIS. The program does not search
forclosedlinestodesignatetheisolines. CDISactsonlytothedesignationoftheisolineswith
the same value. An overwriting can not be prevented always in the case of a different level.
ThetypeFLIEisonlypossibleafteranon-linearcalculation(programsTALPA,ASE-IV).Usually
then the item FROM should be input with zero. In this case only the plasticized areas are

The types ASUM and ASLM are suitable for reinforcement drawings, if reinforcement mats
shouldbeused. Forreinforcementmatswithtransversereinforcementitishelpfultodesignate
the elements with QUAD ASUR and ASLR additionally, if the transverse reinforcements is
larger than 20 percent.
Areinforcementrepresentationasisolinesorincutsisonlyreasonable,ifthepositioningofthe
reinforcement (direction) is equal in all used elements.
Either the values of the nodes are directly available or the values are determined from the
element values. This may be controlled with an input for STYP.
Representation at Cuts (REPR DCUT)
All active DRAW elements with an input for DTYP are cut with the structure (only QUAD
elements). The results are represented as status lines along the cuts. The status lines can be
marked and/or generated as areas. If only one fill pattern was defined, the colours C13 and
C14 and this fill pattern are used.
Somevaluescanbetransformedintothedirectionsofthecut. InthiscaseNisthedirectionof

4.1 Examples for WING
WING includes many possibilities for the representation. Therefore, it is not possible to de-
scribe all combinations and variations in this chapter. The user can find further and possibly
more specific examples in other manuals and in the Internet.
The input files which are explained here are to be found in the installation directory SOFiSTiK
in the subdirectory wing.dat
english. Alternatively you will find these examples via the TEDDY menu HELP > EXAMPLES
sorted by program name and language.
For additional help like tutorials, tutorial movies and practical examples please refer to the
SOFiSTiK Infoportal (www.sofistik.com/Infoportal).

The input generates at first a representation of the system. An axis designation is placed here
at the nodes 3 and 53. Then the loading and the principal moments are drawn according to
their size and direction in the element centres and in the nodes.
Thereinforcementscanberepresentedinanalogmodeasthemoments. Othertypesofrepre-
sentations can be more reasonable because usually the reinforcement layers are orthogonal.
First the generated pictures show the numerical values, then the numerical values which are
larger than a defined basic reinforcement (8.84/5.13) and at last the isolines. The user can
decide with which type the reinforcement is represented. The representation of isolines re-
quires twice so many drawings. However it allows the area-wise registration of the required
steel. Thefollowingpictureshowsthecutsthroughthestructureatwhichthesumofthefound
reinforcement is represented.
A representation of the stresses at the top side of the plate which are available in the direction

Finally, the last drawing is a three-dimensional representation of the deformed structure with
support reactions. This representation is more expressive for the structural behaviour of the
system.

Representation at BRIC Cuts
IfnowaBRICcutisdefinedwiththerecordsMOVEandDRAW,thecuttingareaisusedasthe
represented area and not the BRIC surface. The cutting area is determined with the MOVE-
DRAWlineandthelineofvisioninputwithDTYP.Ifthecuttingareacutstheedgeofavolume
element, the result in the intersection point is interpolated linearly from the beginning node or
end node of this edge.
Further cuts can be defined through the generated cutting areas for the evaluation with the
record SECT. For the cutting definitions attention is to be paid, that the line of vision of this
cuts is defined perpendicular (in the normal direction) to the BRIC cutting area. The definition
of the cut should occur now after the input of the BRIC cut, because perhaps a later input
deletes the BRIC cut (the first MOVE after a drawing deletes all additional elements of the
current group).

to zero. This output is only reasonable, if the cutting areas are defined parallel to the principal
axes and correspond with the correct TYPE.

BRIC cut parallel to the XY plane
The cut is drawn with the records MOVE-DRAW. So that previous cutting definitions do not
affect the representation, these are deleted with an empty MOVE record before a new input:
MOVE
MOVE X 0 Y 0 Z 0.5
DRAW X 0 Y 3 Z 0.5 DTYP BXX
First a three-dimensional representation is selected for a better view of the cut in the system.
The plasticized regions can be represented as isolines at the cutting area:

A cut at which for instance the normal stress Z may be represented can be generated through
the cutting area:
