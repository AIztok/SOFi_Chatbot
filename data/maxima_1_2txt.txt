1 Task Description
The results which were calculated with the SOFiSTiK programs are stored in the database.
ThetaskoftheprogramMAXIMAisthedeterminationofextremevaluesoftheinternalforces,
stresses, displacements, support reactions and results of result sets.
Different methods according to the partial safety concepts of the Eurocode and international
design codes and according to the conventional method without partial safety factors can be
used to determine the maximum values. Here MAXIMA finds the most unfavourable action
effect and applies the combination factors automatically.
To achieve this, the superposition is done in two steps. In the inner step MAXIMA finds the
extreme value from different load cases of the action effect and in a second outer process the
action effects are combined.
The load cases to be superimposed may be defined unconditionally (e.g. dead load) or condi-
tionally(e.g. liveload). Inaconditionalsuperpositioneachloadcaseisonlyappliedifithasan
unfavourable contribution. The definition of loads which exclude each other (alternate loads)
or of loads with changing sign is also possible.
The load cases which are used for the superposition can be combined through arbitrary com-
binationsofthecalculatedloadcases. Thisoccursviathedefinitionofsubsequentloadcases,
whichleadstoanabsolutesuperpositionwiththepreviousloadcases. Eachloadcasemaybe
multipliedwithascalingfactor,sothatnormalisedloadscanbeusedduringthestaticanalysis.
The loads of non-linearly calculated load cases have to be include already the correspond-
ing combination coefficients and safeties. A superposition with action effects (record ACT) is
therefore not implemented. However, it is possible to make an alternative selection via the
load cases only (record LC). Load cases which have been analysed non-linearly can only be
superimposed as individual alternate load cases (TYPE AG1) with the factor 1.
The results are printed and stored in the database for later design or visualisation purposes.
The extent of the output can mainly be controlled by the user. It is recommended to print only
the decisive or manually selected parts of the superposition.
The user should check the superposition by investigating random samples! With the
input of LOAD and FACT in record ECHO all the defined and determined factors and the used
load cases are output for every individual superposition value. Only the relevant superposition
values are printed with all involved factors, if ECHO CHCK is input.

2 Theoretical Principles
2.1 General Information
The superposition rule is determined via the definition of the design code in program AQUA
(record NORM) or for the interactive input with SSD or SOFiPLUS at the beginning. MAXIMA
then automatically uses the design code which is available in the database. The combination
rules of the design codes as well as the National Annexes of the EN 1990 are different. For
example, the EN 1990 with its National Annexes provides action combinations with safety and
combination coefficients. In contrast, old standards such as DIN 1045 (1988) only combine
load cases.
The actions are already defined before the input of the loads in program SOFiLOAD or with
theActionManagerinSSD.Thecorrespondingloadcaseshavetobeallocatedtotheactions.
TheactioncanbeonlymodifiedtemporarilyinMAXIMA.Thesuperpositionisdonewithpartial
safety factors and combination coefficients only for actions defined by arbitrary load cases.
These load cases or combinations of them will be superimposed to define an action effect.
A superposition contains all action effects which are defined by a combination rule with the
record COMB.
The most unfavourable variable action is designated as the leading variable action. MAXIMA
selects the most unfavourable one and considers it according to the chosen combination rule.
When using the explicit defined combination with action groups the determination of three
leading variable actions is possible.
The leading variable actions are marked with a * at sumQ1/sumQ2/sumQ3 (sum of the loads
leading variable action) in the output with ECHO FACT FULL. This variable action which has
the largest difference between sumL (sum of the loads leading variable action) and sumQI
(sum of the loads acting variable) is used as leading variable action! The remaining variable
actions are multiplied with the combination coefficient for the accompanying variable action in
dependence on the combination rule.
The default equations 2.1 till 2.7 correspond to the combinations which are given in the EN
1990 (except for equation 6.10a and 6.10b) and in the DIN 1055-100 / DIN-Fachberichte. For
the special equations 6.10a and 6.10b of the EN 1990 and their use variants in the National
Annexes it is recommended to use the explicit defined combinations.
For design codes, which are used other equations for the combinations e.g. BS 8110, BS
5400,AustralianStandard,IndianStandard,USStandards,itisrecommededtousetheexplicit
defined combination.
IfsuperpositiondefaultsareavailableintheINIfilefortheselecteddesigncode,thesedefaults
are used then in MAXIMA without input for COMB, ACT, ADD, LC and SUPP or in the SSD
tasks Combination Rules and Superpositioning for Combination Rules. Precondition for
this is the usage of the default actions of the record ACT (SOFiLOAD) or of the Loadcase
Manager.

-> Tutorials

The number of processable load cases is limited to 999999. Upon request, the user can re-
peatedlyoverwritepreviouslystoredloadcasesorcanrecombinetheloadcasesfromdifferent
databases with DBINFO or DBMERG.
The results can be stored under a new load case number. Possible available results of former
calculations are deleted, unless, something else is requested with the input CTRL DELE.
The superposition is made separately for each node and for each element or beam or design
element section in the database.
The superposition takes place for all nodes or elements even when not all of them have been
selected. However, only the results for the selected nodes or elements are printed out. For
special cases it is possible to make a selective superposition with the input SUPP OPT S.
When the values to be superimposed are close to zero, then some problems arise for the
imposed loads, in the calculation of the corresponding internal forces. This is handled by the
programMAXIMAinthefollowingmanner: Iftheactualabsolutevalueislessthan10E-6ofthe
maximumvalueofallloadcasesencountered,thentheimposedloadcasesdonotparticipate
in the superposition.
If however the derivation of the quantity being superimposed is known, e.g. the shear force
in the case of a superimposed bending moment, then an imposed load case is used if the
corresponding derivation is positive.

nexes and DIN-Fachbericht

The realization of the equations 6.10a and 6.10b is done in each case via an explicit defined
combination. More information can be found in chapter 2.3 and in chapter 3 at COMB, ADD

2.2.2 Accidental Combinations

The partial safety factor γ g,A for the permanent actions and γ A for the accidental actions is
determined with the input GAMA in record ACT. The default for both partial safety factors is
definedindependenceontheselecteddesigncodeintheINIfileandisautomaticallyavailable.
The EN 1990 plans the use of ψ 2,1·Q k,1 (= all variable actions with ψ 2) as a second variant
for the accidental design combination. This variant has to be done with the explicit defined
combination COMB EXTR EXPL. An input variant is for example:
COMB 1 EXTR EXPL TYPE ACCI BASE 3100

Actions with type seismic action (E) and accidental actions (A) are processed also in equation

j≥1 ≥1 
For design codes which do not plan the combination coefficient ψ 1 (e.g. OEN 4700 accidental
combination) the leading variable action is determined and multiplied by ψ 2. If a higher co-
efficient ψ 2 than ψ 1 is input, this higher coefficient ψ 2 is used for the leading variable action.
MAXIMA uses here the maximum (ψ 1,ψ 2). In analog mode the maximum (ψ 1,ψ 2,ψ 1,nƒq) is
considered for the leading variable action for a superposition of the infrequent combination
(equation 2.6).
The user should be aware that only the sum of all load cases defines the partial safety factor
which is valid for an action effect (see record ACT).
2.3 Superposition with Explicit Defined Combination
For superpositions which do not correspond to the equations 2.1 till 2.7 there is the possibility
for the user to combine special superpositions with factors. For this an explicit defined com-
bination has to be selected with EXTR EXPL in record COMB. Actions or action groups with
corresponding factors are combined for the combination with the relevant record ADD. The
actions must be defined before in SOFiLOAD and to be available in the database after the
calculation.
With the record ADA only certain actions which are available in the database can be used
for an explicit defined combination with action groups (e.g. ADD {Q1}) bzw. {QI}) ... for
variable actions). Without the selection with the record ADA, all actions are considered from
the database.
An example for the use of the explicit defined combination is the superposition for design
according to the Swiss code SIA 262. According to SIA 260 a superposition at which only
ψ 0 and no γ are to be considered for the accompanying variable actions is necessary for the
check at ultimate limit state:
 
(cid:88) (cid:88) 
E =E γ ·G ⊕γ ·P ⊕γ ·Q ⊕ ψ ·Q
d G,j k,j P k Q,1 k,1 0, k,
j≥1 >1 

An input for the explicit defined combination with permanent and variable actions, where only
Q, W and S should be used as variable actions, reads for example:
COMB 1 EXTR EXPL TYPE DESI
ADD {G} FACU GAM
ADD {Q1} FACU GAMU FACF 0.0
ADA Q,W,S
ADD {QI} FACU PSI0 FACF 0.0
ADA Q,W,S
Thedefinitionisdonehereviaactiongroups,whereitisdefinedat{Q1}thataleadingvariable
action is available. The leading variable action is considered in the unfavourable case with the
corresponding partial safety factor γ. The following actions {QI} get only the combination
coefficient ψ 0 as unfavourable factor.
Another possibility is to prescribe a special action as leading variable action (e.g. according to
French BAEL). A possible input with single actions is for example according to BAEL (D2.2,1
design resistance for buildings, first line of the table):
COMB 1 EXPL TYPE DESI
ADD G FACU GAM
ADD QB FACU 1.5 FACF 0.0 $leading variable action$
ADD W FACU PSIU FACF 0.0
ADD S FACU PSIU FACF 0.0
ADD T_1 FACU 0.8 FACF 0.0
The leading variable action is here QB with the factor (γ) 1.5 in the unfavourable case. The
accomanyingvariableactionsWandSareconsideredwiththefactorγ·ψ 0 intheunfavourable
case and T_1 with 0.8.
For a combination which uses ADD it is also possible to input together actions and action
groups. For example it is useful, if a specific variable action is the leading variable action and

2.4 Simplified Superpositions
Simplified superpositions are described for German DIN 18800, Austrian OENORM 4300 and
SOFiSTiK2023 2-5MAXIMA|TheoreticalPrinciples
Russian SNIP.
2.4.1 Ultimate Limit State Check: Fundamental Combination
The German DIN 18800, the Austrian OENORM 4300, the Russian SNIP and other design
codes include a simplified superposition with partial safety factors for the ultimate limit state
check:
either: consideration of only one variable action Q with the partial safety factor γ
S  =γ g·G k⊕γ q,1·Q k,1 (2.8)
or: consideration of all variable actions Q with the partial safety factors γ·ψ (e.g. for German
DIN 18800 = 1.5 · 0.9 = 1.35)
(cid:88)
S  =γ g·G k⊕ γ q,·ψ q,·Q k, (2.9)
Both superpositions have to be analysed according to the design code. Only the most un-
favourablesuperpositionisdecisive. MAXIMAprocessesinternallybothequationsandoutput,
however, only the more unfavourable superposition.
Ifanactionwithtypeseismicaction(E)isavailable,thenthisactionisprocessedwithequation
(8) and (9) because an explicit superposition with seismic combination is not planned here.
2.4.2 Ultimate Limit State Check: Accidental Combination
The simplified superposition for the accidental combination is only allowed for German DIN
18800 and Austrian OENORM 4300.
For accidental combinations according to German DIN 18800 and Austrian OENORM 4300
thepermanentactionsGareused,however,with γ g =1.0andallvariableactionsQ,however,
with γ = 0.9 (= 0.9 · 1.0) according to the equations 2.8 and 2.9. Additionally the accidental
action FA is considered as follows:
F A,d =γ F·F ,k (2.10)
with γ F = 1.0
2.4.3 Serviceability Limit State Check: Characteristic (Rare) Combination
For the simplified check of serviceability (characteristic combination)according to DIN 18800
and OENORM 4300 following superposition is possible in program MAXIMA record COMB:
either: consideration of only one variable action Q
S r =G k⊕Q k,1 (2.11)
or: consideration of all variable actions Q with the combination coefficient ψ (e.g. for German
DIN 18800 ψ = 0.9)
(cid:88)
S r =G k⊕ ψ q,·Q k, (2.12)

2.5 Superposition without any Partial Safety Factors and Coefficients
Foradefineddesigncode(e.g. GermanDIN1045old)whichdemandsasuperpositionwithout
partial safety factors and combination coefficients the scalar variable of an initial load case is
considered (factor 1.0) or not considered (factor 0.0) during the superposition.
2.6 Superposition of Non-linearly Analysed Load Cases
For a superposition of non-linearly analysed load cases an envelope is formed. Only load
cases without factors are superimposed here and only one decisive load case is determined.
The superposition of non-linearly analysed load cases is only permitted, if the load cases
are defined via alternative groups (record LC type AG1) or if the calculation occurred with
a linearised calculation according to OENORM. If using the literal NONL for EXTR in record
COMB, the load cases are processed automatically with TYPE AG1. It is to be noted here,
that no action (no record ACT) has to be entered in MAXIMA even if the defined design code
prescribes actions for superpositions after linear calculations.
2.7 Intermediate Superposition
For special projects it can be necessary to execute an intermediate superposition. The deter-
minedresultloadcasesofanintermediatesuperpositioncanbeusedthenasinitialloadcases
for further combinations. For an intermediate superposition it is also possible here to assign
the result load cases with COMB TYPE to an action which was defined before in SOFiLOAD.
2.7.1 Intermediate Superposition using Load Groups
When using load groups with ACT PART Q_1 till Q_99 it is possible to make intermediate
superpositionsinternallywithinaMAXIMArun,e.g. forrelevanttrafficloads. Thesuperposition
with load groups is shown and described in the example file maxima_loadgroups.dat.
For comparison the intermediate superposition with explicit MAXIMA definitions is shown in
the example file maxima_intermediate-superposition.dat.
2.7.2 Input Example: Hangar with Seismic Design
Ahangarwithtwocraneshastobedesignedforseismicloading. Inthiscasethestandardload
cases dead load (1 and 2) and three imposed load cases (4,5,6) are first available. The two
independentlymovingcranes,eachofthemwith36differentloadpositionswhicharestoredin
the database with the load case numbers 101 to 172, are considered additionally.
In a first step the extreme values of this loading are generated when the imposed loads and
the crane loads are superimposed in three alternative groups. This requires, that one of the
imposed load cases covers the full load.

Now the seismic loads are added. These have been analyzed with the program DYNA. First
a lot of results which are based on the response spectra method and separated with respect
to the three coordinate axis (301,304 and 307) are generated. For the design of the structural
elements these loads with alternating sign of the maximum have to be considered and in ad-
dition in the combinations at the corner as well as in the combinations horizontal and vertical.
The vertical loading is scheduled in this case either fully with a factor 1.3 or additionally to the
horizontal loading only with a factor of 0.5.

2.8 Modification of Partial Safety Factors and Combination Coeffi-
cients
The partial safety factors and combination coefficients which are preset in the INI files can
be modified with different possibilities of the input in SOFiLOAD and/or MAXIMA. E.g. only
single load cases can get other values (SOFiLOAD record LC) than the corresponding action.
However, following specifications should be considered here for the superposition:
1. If a partial safety factor and/or a combination coefficient is modified for a load case
(SOFiLOAD record LC) and no modification of the action is done in MAXIMA, then the
valuefortheloadcasewhichwasinputinSOFiLOADLCwinsduringthesuperposition.
2. If a partial safety factor and/or a combination coefficient is modified for a load case
(SOFiLOAD record LC) and a modification of the action is done in MAXIMA (record
ACT), then the in MAXIMA modified value for the action wins during the superposition
and not the value from the load case (SOFiLOAD).
Example:
SOFiLOAD: action snow - unfavourable partial safety factor GAMU with default 1.5, modified
only for load case 6 to 1.4
ACT S
LC 5
$load input for LC 5$
LC 6 gamu 1.4
$load input for LC 6$
Case 1: no further modification of GAMU in the MAXIMA input MAXIMA printout Design fun-
damental combination DESI default - without modification in MAXIMA for ACT S:

5 1.00 Conditional LC Snow
6 1.00 Conditional LC Snow

The above described procedure is different for an explicit defined combination with COMB
EXTR EXPL and ADD: The action/action groups are defined in MAXIMA with record ADD for
theexplicitdefinedcombination. Forsuchacombinationonlyanunfavourableandafavourbale
factor has to be defined. That means, that the factors are available for all load cases of the
action which is defined with record ADD or all load cases have the same factors FACU and
FACF for the action at ADD.

3 Input Description
3.1 Input Language
The input occurs in a free format with the CADINP input language (see the general manual
SOFiSTiK: ’Basics’).
Three categories of units are distinguished:
mm Fixed unit. Input is always required in the specified unit.
[mm] Explicit unit. Input defaults to the specified unit. Alternatively, an explicit as-
signment of a related unit is possible (eg. 2.5[m] ).
[mm] Implicit unit. Implicit units are categorised semantically and denoted by a cor-
1011
responding identity number (shown in green). Valid categories referring to the
unit ”length” are, for example, geodetic elevation, section length and thickness.
Thedefaultunitforeachcategoryisdefinedbythecurrentlyactive(designcode
specific) unit set. This input default can be overridden as described above. The
specified unit in square brackets corresponds to the default for unit set 5 (Eu-
rocodes, NORM UNIT 5).

The records HEAD, END and PAGE are described in the general manual SOFiSTiK: ’Basics’.
The records COMB and SUPP should be input. If the actions (record ACT) and the load
cases(recordLC)shouldbetakenoverwithoutmodificationsfromthedatabase(fromprogram
SOFiLOAD), the records ACT and LC do not have to be input then. If, however, an action or
a load case should get a modification in MAXIMA, the complete superposition definition (all
records ACT and LC) has to be input here.
It is to be noted that the actions (record ACT) and the relevant load cases can be only se-
lected and possible modified in MAXIMA. They have to be defined before with the program
SOFiLOAD.

the current program run is stored. However, it is necessary that results for all nodes, elements
and beam sections must have already been stored in the database, because the program can
not insert anything between two data records.
If for example two results from a concentrated load have to be stored for a beam section, then
they must already be present in the load case which is to be overwritten, otherwise an error
message (No. -3 in MUDS) occurs.
All combination rules and superposition commands which are available in the database are

havetobealreadyavailableinthedatabase(definitioninprogramSOFiLOAD)andcanbeonly
modified in MAXIMA with the record ACT. It is also possible to define combinations without
actions.
MAXIMA takes the design code to be used for the combination rule from the database. The
user has to specify the design code right at the beginning of the task, either in the program
AQUA (record NORM) or in the case of an interactive input with the SSD at System Informa-
tion.
IfusinganexplicitcombinationwithEXTREXPLthedefinitionofactionsoractiongroupsmust
follow with the records ADD and ADA. An input of the record ACT after COMB EXTR EXPL is
SOFiSTiK2023 3-19MAXIMA|InputDescription
not allowed.
3.6.1 Literal EXTR - Kind of Superposition
Thecombinationrulewhichcorrespondstothedesigncodeinthedatabaseisdeterminedwith
EXTR. Which of the input literals are allowed for a design code is defined in the INI file of the
relevant design code. It is possible to modify the defaults in the INI file.
DESI, ACCI and EARQ are to use for checks in ultimate limit state and PERM, RARE, FREQ
and NONF for checks in serviceability limit state.
For the simplified superpositions (e.g. German DIN 18800, OENORM 4300) DESI-V, ACCI-V
or RARE-V have to be input. The Russian SNIP 2.01.07-85 allows the superpositions DESI-V,
ACCI and RARE-V.
STAN - unspecified design combination should be used for design codes without partial safety
factors and combination coefficients (e.g. German DIN 1045 old).
NONL is planned for a combination with non-linear calculated load cases (determination of an
enveloped). Action (record ACT) are not allowed here. The input load cases are considered
compulsorily with TYPE AG1 in record LC.
In the following table the input possibilities for EXTR are printed with the relevant defaults for
TYPE:

3.6.2 Literal TYPE - Type of the result load cases
The type of the result load cases are defined with TYPE. The defaults for TYPE are defined in
the INI file and can be modified there.
With that it is also possible to use the result load cases for further superposition. The literals
which exist in record ACT can be used here for TYPE for an intermediate superposition. In
this case it is to be noted that the action has be defined already with a record ACT in program
SOFiLOAD. The definition of a new action is not possible in record COMB.
For design codes without partial safety factors and combination coefficients (e.g. German DIN
1045 old) and for German DIN 1052 also STAN - general design combination, H - primary
loads or HZ - primary and additional loads can be input.
With the EN 1995 (EC5) and the derived design codes correction factors kmod have been
introduced for the permissible stresses and kdeƒ for the deformations. The distinct value is
dependingnotonlyonthematerialbutalsoontheserviceclassandthedurationoftheloading.
The information about the duration of the loading has to be available at the superposition load
cases. This is done via an input of PT, LT, MT, ST or VT for TYPE.
If using a free defined combination rule with EXTR EXPL or the combination of non-linear
calculatedloadcaseswithEXTRNONL,thetypeoftheresultantloadcasesmustbeexplicitly

institutions etc.
III 1.0 Ordinary buildings, not belonging to the other categories
IV 0.8 Buildings of minor importance for public safety, e.g. agricultural buildings,

In principal every action may be subdivided by categories. For some action types (Q, L or

A definition of ACT will reinitialize the action with the defaults defined in the INI-file depending
on the category of the design code. Values GAMU to PS1S replace the predefined values.
The user should check the defaults in all cases. Deviations of the PSI-values for wind and
temperature especially for bridges or other non buildings are to be expected as all values are
"boxed values" depending on individual or country dependant settings. For example you will
findinOENORMB4750categorieswithtrucksbetween30and60kNwithvaluesaugmented

in an own action L (with categories L_F, L_G and L_H) or whether these categories should be
a part of the action Q in addition to the payloads for buildings (categories Q_A till Q_H).
If the category of the design code or the design code is changed in AQUA, all actions should
be redefined. ACT INIT deletes all defined actions and superposition rules if specified in
SOFiLOAD.

The item PART defines, to which action of the selected superposition equation the input ac-
tion belongs. The actions in the superposition equations are distinguished according to their
temporal variances:
• permanent actions: PART G e.g dead load
PART P prestress
• variable actions PART Q
PART Q_1 load group 1
PART Q_2 load group 2
...
PART Q_99 load group 99

ThustheitemPARTallowsthecorrectclassificationofuser-definedactions,butalsoofspecial
cases as for example PART G SUP ALEX (always but exclusive, it means, that only one load
case is always used). Exclusively the item SUP controls, how the load cases which are a part

The item PART depends on TYPE for preset actions. For example PART G is the default for
theactionsG,G_1andG_2,PARTPfortheactionsPandC,PARTQfortheactionsQandL,
PART A for the action A and PART E for the action E.
The item PART has to be input for user-defined actions. Otherwise the user-defined actions
get PART Q (default).
Hint
All categories of an action must have the same definition of PART. E.g. categories Q_A
and Q_B of the variable action Q get PART Q. Only the load groups of a variable action
PART Q_1 till Q_99 can be different.
TheitemSUPdefinesthedefaulttreatmentofmultipleloadcaseswithinanaction. Thedefault
will be taken from the INI-File, but for free defined types of actions it is EXCL in general, if the
type of the action has a leading Q it will become COND and for a leading G it will be PERM.
In MAXIMA one may overwrite this for any particular load case of an action or recombine
load cases (e.g. 0.7*LC_101(Ex)+0.5*LC_102(Ey)). Due to historic reasons there are special
literals at record LC in MAXIMA in addition to the literals of SUP:

Using SUP PERM the same partial safety factor is used for all load cases of a permanent
action (e.g. ACT G). In this case the sum of the values of the single load cases is decisive,
whether the unfavourable (GAMU) or the favourable (GAMF) partial safety factor is applied. In
the contrast to that the partial safety factors are considered load-case-wisely, if SUP PERC is
defined. Here one load case of the permanent action can get GAMU and another GAMF.
SUP EXEX excludes only categories against each other within an action (no exclusion
of different actions). If for example the categories X_1 and X_2 of the action X are defined
with SUP EXEX, then only the most unfavourable load case is used either from X_1 or from
X_2andalsoonly,ifithasanunfavourablecontribution. Inthecontrasttothatanunfavourable

load case from X_1 and an unfavourable load case from X_2 are used for the input of SUP
EXCL.
SUP ALEX defines a permanent alternative group (MAXIMA record LC TYPE AG1). Only
the load cases of an action or all load cases of the categories of an action are used for the
formationofapermanentalternativegroup. Hereonlyaloadcaseisconsideredforthesuper-
position, also if it has a favourable contribution. Load cases of different actions do not exclude
themselves mutually. If SUP ALEX is input for some actions, a load case is considered per
action.
In program MAXIMA it is additionally possible to assign load cases of an action or category to
severalpermanentalternativegroups. TheinputisdoneinprogramMAXIMAwithLC... TYPE

The total mechanism of the defaults for the action types is governed by the following rules:
• ByselectingadesigncodewithinAQUAalldefinitionsgivenintheassociatedINI-Fileinthe
[action] -section will become available. If no such file is available, defaults in the program
are available for all EC and newer DIN (since year 2000). For all other cases there are
exactly two predefined actions G and Q without any coefficients or factors.
• When addressing an action, a copy of this definition is created in the database which has
then the possibility of deviating factors if explicitly defined with this record or via the SOFi-
PLUS menus.
• When creating a load case, the factors are copied from the action definition to the load
case. However, those factors may be modified for any individual load case.
• For special design purposes the factors may be changed temporarily when using the load
cases in AQB.
Variable action - load groups:
TheloadgroupsPARTQ_1tillQ_99canbeusedforabetterformationofcombinationwithout
intermediate superpositions in MAXIMA e.g. for the load models of the bridge design (EN
1990/A1). If different load groups are defined for categories with corresponding inputs for the
item SUP, then the intermediate superpositions and the following superpositions are done in
one MAXIMA run.
Example:

First of all three load groups Q_1, Q_2 and Q_3 are defined with PART in the program

mutually exclusive only within the respective category about the input SUP EXCL. The cate-
goriesXY_CandXY_Dareapartoftheloadgroups2and3. Allloadcasesofbothcategories
are mutually exclusive about the input SUP EXEX.
With one of the MAXIMA combinations then the superposition is done as follows: First of all
MAXIMA searches which load cases of the load group 1 are decisive (possible one ore two or
noloadcase=firstintermediatesuperposition).Thenthedecisiveloadcaseoftheloadgroups
2 and 3 is determined (possible one or no load case = second intermediate superposition). In
the last step the final superposition is done. Either the decisive load cases of the load group 1
or the decisive load case of the goups 2 and 3 are here the final result.
It should be noted here that load groups are mutually exclusive. If, for example, the superpo-
sition of the load cases for two load load groups are specified with SUP COND - conditionally,
only the load cases of the decisive load group are taken into account.
Example:
PROG SOFILOAD
HEAD
ACT XY_1 gamu 1.4 0.0 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.6 PART Q_1 SUP cond
ACT XY_2 gamu 1.3 0.0 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.5 PART Q_2 SUP cond
The load cases of category XY_1 belong to load group 1 and those of category XY_2 belong
to load group 2. Thus, either the load cases of XY_1 or of XY_2 are taken into account in the
superposition depending on which brings the more unfavorable result.

With LC any desired combinations can be analysed or already combined load cases may be
defined for the superposition. Each load case can be used repeatedly for different load case
types. Therefore, under certain circumstances, it is possible to work with unit load cases in a
static analysis.
3.10.1 Default for NO - Load Case Number
The default is NO 0 - All loadcases with same type as the action for all actions which do not
have a category. When additionally categories are available, then the default is NO -1 All
loadcases of the same category.
Examples:
Following action is available with the relevant load cases:
Q variable load with load case 2 and 3
ThusthedefaultishereLCNO0=Allloadcaseswiththesametypeastheaction. Thatmeans
that the load cases 2 and 3 are allocated to the action Q without explicit input for LC.
If only categories, e.g. Q_B and Q_C, are defined for the action Q:
Q_B payload for buildings offices with load case 4 and 5
Q_C payload for buildings assembly rooms with load case 6 and 7
3-36 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|MAXIMA
then the default for both categories is LC NO -1 = All loadcases of the same category.
In the third case the action and additionally categories with relevant load cases are input:
Q variable load with load cases 2 and 3
Q_1 free defined category with load cases 4 and 5
Q_2 free defined category with load cases 6 and 7
The default for the action Q and for the categories Q_1 and Q_2 is in each case LC NO -1 =
All loadcases of the same category, if an input for ACT is not done or if only ACT Q is input
in MAXIMA. This means that the load cases 2,3 are arranged to Q, the load cases 4,5 to Q_1
and the load cases 6,7 to Q_2.
Following inputs are also possible for the third case:
ACT Q
LC -1 $all LC of the same category -> here only LC 2 and 3$
ACT Q_1
LC -1 $all LC of the same category -> LC 4 and 5$
ACT Q_2
LC -1 $all LC of the same category -> LC 6 and 7$
or
ACT Q $without an input for LC !$
If, however, following MAXIMA input is available
ACT Q
ACT Q_1
ACT Q_2
the categories are considered twice with their load cases (Q_1 with LC 4,5 and Q_2 with LC
6,7).
Caution:
With the input
ACT Q
LC 0 $all load cases with the same type as the action$
the load cases of the categories Q_1 (LC 4,5) and Q_2 (LC 6,7) are arranged to the action
Q. This results in the consequence, that the definitions of Q_1 and Q_2 for SUP of the record
ACT are not considered anymore. Here the definition SUP of the action Q is valid. The partial
safety factors and combination coefficients are arranged, however, to the load case and they
do not changed.
3.10.2 Differentiation and Default for TYPE
Differentiation of TYPE PERM and PERC
SOFiSTiK2023 3-37MAXIMA|InputDescription
TYPE PERM The decision whether all load cases of a permanent action with
PART G or P are taken into account as favourable or unfavourable
is effected by determination of sums. It means that either the
favourable or unfavourable factor is used for all load cases.
TYPE PERC The decision whether the load cases of a permanent action with
PART G or P are taken into account as favourable or unfavourable
is effected loadcase-wise. It means that the load cases can get
different factors within a permanent action.
A mixing of load case with TYPE PERC and other types (PERM, ALEX) is not recommended.
In this case, the load cases should be assigned to different permanent actions.
Differentiation of TYPE AG1-AG99 and A1-A99
TYPE AG1-AG99 The most unfavourable load case of a permanentalternative load
case group within one action is determined and added. But one
loadcaseisusedalwaysforeachalternativegroupperoneaction.
TYPE A1-A99 Themostunfavourableloadcaseofthealternativeloadcasegroup
is determined and it is only added, if it acts unfavourably.
Consideration of load cases with TYPE AG1-AG99 or ALEX, if they are a part of a permanent
action e.g. G:
Forloadcases,whichhavetheTYPEAG1-AG99orALEXandwhichareapartofapermanent
actionanditscategories,thesumofallvaluesofthepermanentactionisdecisivewhetherthe
load cases are favourable or unfavourable. This is the same procedure as for TYPE PERM.
Follow-up load case F
If a follow-up load case is defined, it is considered only, if the relevant main load case has a
part for the superposition.
Example:
ACT W $variable action wind$
LC 11 TYP A1 $main load case$
LC 12 TYP F $follow-up load case$
If the load case 11 of the variable action W acts favourably and thus it does not have a part for
the superposition, then also the load case 12 is not considered.
Default for TYPE:
The default depends on the default superposition of the load cases (SUP), which is input with
record ACT. All superpositions SUP PERM get the TYPE G, all superpositions SUP COND
get the TYPE Q, all superpositions SUP EXCL get the TYPE A1 ..., all superpositions SUP
UNSIgetthetypeW,allsuperpositionsSUPUSEXgettheTYPEX1.... andallsuperpositions
SUP ALEX get the TYPE AG1. SUP PERC of the record ACT corresponds to TYPE PERC.
Modifications of the types are only temporarily processed in MAXIMA. That means
3-38 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|MAXIMA
these inputs are only considered in this MAXIMA calculation. The default from record
ACT SUP is overlaid then! In case of doubt it is recommended to use the default from
record ACT and not input a literal for TYPE at LC.
The default for the input with the standard combination (COMB EXTR STAN) is for TYPE as
follows:
load case 1: G
all other load cases: Q
Amongtheloadcasesofanalternativeloadcasegroup,onlytheonewiththemostdetrimental
effect is used for a superposition. The load case with the most detrimental effect among the
groups A1 to A99, X1 to X99 is handled as a live load, i.e. if none of the load cases has a
detrimentaleffect,thesegroupsarenottakenintoconsiderationatall. However,oneloadcase
is always considered for the permanent alternative load case groups AG1 to AG99. The as-
signmentofthealternativegroupstooneormoreACTrecordsisdecisiveforthesuperposition
result.
The superposition of non-linearly analysed load cases is only permitted, if they are superim-
posed using TYPE AG1 without the ACT record. If using the literal NONL for EXTR in record
COMB, the load cases are processed automatically with TYPE AG1. Then the program cal-
culates the effective load case as a selection from a series of non-linear analyses (extreme
values boundary lines).
If no record LC and no record ACT are defined, all load cases in the database, which were
analysed linearly, are used for the superposition. In this case either the definitions which are
alreadyavailableinthedatabaseor, ifnodefinitionsareavailable, thedefaultsinMAXIMAare
used.
3.10.3 Remarks on FACT
Using FACT, an additional factor can be defined for the initial load cases, with which the cor-
responding internal force (value to be superimposed) is multiplied. The multiplication with the
factor is done before the actual superposition. This is important, if a negative factor (e.g. -1.0)
isused. Inthiscasetheloadcaseswhichinitiallysupplyanunfavourablecontributionareused
then as favourable for the superposition and vice versa.

The program MAXIMA calculates the for the superposition decisive factors of the nodal
displacements and rotations from the relevant superpositions of the support reactions or
support moments.
If only a superposition of nodal displacements or rotations is done, it is to be noted that
no factors are output in the list of nodal displacements (ECHO FACT). The output of the
factors is printed here always in the list of the support reactions in nodes, also if they are
not superimposed and thus they are printed with zero.

When using stresses as superposition type, it is to be noted that MAXIMA determines

forces and moments. Stresses are superimposed and printed only after a calculation for
the plane strain state in the program TALPA.

3.11.2 Definition of the Load Case Numbers
In combination with the basic load case number BASE in record COMB and the storage load
case number LC three possibilities are available, with which one can define the load case
numbers that are to be used:
1. Input of BASE in record COMB (BASE ≥ 100) and no input for LC
The following up to a six-digit load case number is generated with the defaulted values
of LC (tables above):
LC new = BASE + default LC
2. BASE not input in record COMB or input with zero and input of LC with the con-
ditionLC ≥ 100
With that a user defined load case number is produced:
LC new = value input for LC
or continuous numbering for following saved load case numbers. Load case numbers
up to 999999 are possible.
3. BASE not input in record COMB or negative and no input for LC
Four-digitloadcasenumbersareassignedforsuperpositionswithactions(recordACT)
as follows:
The default for BASE in record COMB describes the first and second digit of the four-
digit load case number as follows:
for the serviceability limit state
11xx characteristic (rare) combination
12xx infrequent combination
13xx frequent combination
14xx quasi-permanent combination
for the ultimate limit state
3-50 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|MAXIMA
21xx design fundamental combination
22xx design accidental combination
23xx design seismic combination
A four-digit load case number is generated from the defaults of BASE and LC (table
above):
LC new = four-digit load case number of the results
Example for case 3 with actions (record ACT):
The maximum bending moments m-xx of a plate (QUAD elements) should be determined in
the ultimate limit state for the ultimate design combination. BASE in record COMB and LC are
not input. With that the number 2101 is generated for the superposition load case max m-xx:
from the default for BASE
21xx design fundamental combination
and from the default for LC
xx01 max m-xx for ETYP QUAD/QUAK (table above)
= generated load case number 2101 for max m-xx
Automatically generated load case numbers for superposition without actions
Forsuperpositionswithoutactions(withoutrecordACT,e.g. GermanDIN1045old),thegener-
ated load cases are numbered as follows:
LC new = four-digit load case number of the defaults
for the first two digits:
21xx design fundamental combination
for the 3rd and 4th digit:
default values of LC (tables above)
If several state variables which are separated with commas should be defined for TYPE and
if the generated load cases should get load case numbers which are different from the default
and which are not continuous (case 2: no input of BASE in record COMB and own definition
of LC), then the load case numbers are to be input for every state variable with LC separated
with a comma.
Example: The maximum and minimum values of N,VZ,MY should be determined for a frame
and girder system. The following load case numbers should be defined:
MAX-N LC 121 MIN-N LC 122
MAX-VZ LC 131 MIN-VZ LC 132
MAX-MY LC 141 MIN-MY LC 142
SOFiSTiK2023 3-51MAXIMA|InputDescription
Thus the input reads:
EXTR MAMI ETYP BEAM TYPE N,VZ,MY LC 121,131,141
However, if the result load case numbers should be continuous, then it is sufficient to indicate
the first number for LC. Following input
EXTR MAMI ETYP BEAM TYPE N,VZ,MY LC 121
defines the six result load case numbers from number 121 to 126.
Several records SUPP can be generated the same load case numbers, as long as they use
the same combination rule.
Using the preset combinations from an INI file the result load case numbers have a default
according to the chosen INI file. They can be modified in the SSD tasks: ’Combination Rules’
and ’Superpositioning for Combination Rules’.
3.11.3 Output Extent
With FROM, TO and INC it is possible to control the output of structural elements, groups or
individual elements. This is useful for instance, if superposition results should be checked
with random samples for all the used load cases and factors (ECHO LOAD,FACT). In a first
internal calculation MAXIMA determines the superposition results of all elements. In a second
calculationonlytheselectedelementsareconsidered. Onlytheselectedelementsareprinted
then.
Selection of structural elements:
Results of elements can be also printed in dependence on the selected structural element. In
this case the literals SLN or SAR have to be choosen at FROM. The number of the structural
elementcanthenbedefinedatTO.AninputatINChasherenoeffect. Aselectionofstructural
areas is not possible for nodal results.
Group selection:
Results of elements can be also printed groupwise. In this case the literal GRP has to be
choosen at FROM. The group number or the name of a secondary group can then be defined
at TO. An input at INC has here no effect.
A group selection is not possible for nodal results. If the internal forces and moments in the
nodes of plane and volume elements (ETYP QNOD, BNOD) should be printed groupwise, the
group number has to be defined at SELE.
Element selection:
If an element selection is desired, then the element or node numbers can be input at FROM
andTOwhereatINCdefinestheincrement. Inthecaseofaninputofonlyanelementornode
number at FROM only the superpositon result of this number is printed.

3.11.4 Determination of the Square Root SRSS and SRSE
The determination of the square root from the sum of the squares SRSS or SRSE is only pos-
sible for a standard superposition (COMB EXTR STAN, no actions). Follow-up and alternative
loadcasesarenotallowed. FactorsforloadcaseswhicharedefinedinrecordLCatFACTare
notconsidered. Itisrecommendedtouseasuperpositionwiththeobjectfunction(see3.11.6).
SUPP EXTR SRSS creates two load cases (SRMA for maximum and SRMI for minimum).
Only permanent or unfavourable load cases are considered here. In the case of variable load

the maximum SRMA does not use initial values of a variable load case with a negative sign.

for maximum and SRMI ENV for minimum). However, only the result values of the leading
superposition values are determined. These are printed as associated values for the other,

Figure3.9: Crosssectionpoints
The definition of the cross section point is necessary for a superposition with the scalar vari-
ables normal stress in cross section point (TYPE SIG) and shear stress in cross section point
(TYPETAU).MAXIMAsuperimposeshereonlyinternalforcesandmoments. Thatmeans,that
these internal forces and moments which fulfil the superposition criterion MAX-SIG, MIN-SIG,
MAX-TAU or MIN-TAU for the corresponding cross section point are determined.
If TYPE SIG or TAU is defined for some cross section points within one MAXIMA block, the
resultant load case numbers are increased about 1.
The cross section points can also be defined separated by commas in a record SUPP accord-
ing to the rules CADINP, e.g.

shear force of plates can be also from interest and can be generated with the shear forces v-x
andv-y. Theuserhasthepossibilitytoformareasonablecombinationofsuperpositionvalues
by using a objective function.
A objective function is generated with superposition values (described above at TYPE) and
perhaps with factors or defined variables (LET or STO variables). An objective function for
example for the resultant shear force of a plate reads as follows:
SUPP COMB 1 EXTR mami ETYP quad TYPE 'SQR(VX**2+VY**2)' LC 101
Using the objective function, then some rules are to be considered:
• The superposition values areto be combined reasonably. Only the superposition values of
one element type ETYP are to be defined.
• TherulesforCADINParevalid. Anobjectivefunctionshouldbeinputwithquotationmarks
’...’. Blanks are avoid.
• The result load case number of a superposition with an objective function has to be input
manually.
Thedeterminationofansuperpositionresultwithanobjectivefunctionrunsexactlywithalinear
function. For a quadratic function it is to be noted that following relationship is valid
(+y)2 >2+y2
If a factor which is defined either explicitly or with a variable is input, it is to be noted that the
factor is used only for the weighting during processing of the objective function. This factor
does not come in into the numerical value of the superposition result! As an use for that the
determination of the boundary stresses is mentioned.
The user is even responsible for the superposition with an objective function. The user
should check the superposition here! With the input of LOAD and FACT in record ECHO
all the defined and determined factors and the used load cases are output for every individual
superpositionvalue. Onlytherelevantsuperpositionvaluesareprintedwithallinvolvedfactors,
if ECHO CHCK is input.
Possibilities of an input of an objective function are subsequently described here:
SUPP 1 EXTR mami ETYP node TYPE 'PX+PY' LC 5101
describes as objective function an addition of the support reactions PX and PY.
The Definition of the variable STO#fact 2.5 and
SUPP 1 EXTR mami ETYP node TYPE '#(fact,2.1)*PX+PY' LC 5101
describe as objective function an addition of the support reactions PX and Py where PX is
used with a 2.5-times weighting. The input #(fact,2.1) has the effect that the CADINP variable
is used with maximal two digits before and one digit behind the ., therefore with 2.5. If only
#factisinput,thenthevalueofthevariableisroundedoffon3,becauseCADINPusedsoonly
integer values. It is also possible to input the factor 2.5 directly into the objective function:

3.11.7 Use of Result Sets
Result sets are used for grouping and for common evaluation of results. They are defined in
program SOFiMSHA with RSET. In MAXIMA it is possible to determine the relevant values for
a result value. These are for example support reactions in several points and spring forces in
different directions.
ForevaluationtheliteralRSEThastobeinputatETYP,therespectiveIDofthesingleelements
at TYPE and the respective ID of the set (header in SOFiMSHA) at FROM. The ID of the set
(header in SOFiMSHA) and the respective single elements can be a number or a literal. It
is to be considered that an ID, which is defined as a number, can be input with or without
apostrophes both in the program SOFiMSHA and in MAXIMA. The input has to be identical in
both programs.
The results sets have to be input separately. Several result sets can be also defined as a
CADINP loop. An input for TO is not allowed.
The result load case number of a superposition with a results set has to be input manually. It
should be noted here, that different result load case numbers have to be defined for different
RSET.

SUM
Item Description Unit Default
COMB Number of the combination rule − 1
LC Load case number for the results − !
TITL Designation of the superposition load case Lt32 -
Using record SUM, sums of results from individual load cases with manually defined factors
can be determined. Therefore, the use of record SUM is only allowed for standard com-
binations COMB EXTR STAN and related initial load cases which have to be defined as
permanent. All defined initial load cases are always taken into account for the determination
of the sum, even if they have a favourable effect.
Example:
COMB 1 EXTR STAN TYPE DESI
LC 1 TYPE PERM FACT 1.35
LC 2 TYPE PERM FACT 1.5
LC 4 TYPE PERM FACT 1.5
LC 8 TYPE PERM FACT 1.05
The superposition values are determined automatically for the respective system.
The combination rule is automatically deleted after calculation of the superposition results.
Only the superposition results are stored in the database. Therefore, it is not possible to
execute superpositions with record SUPP simultaneously with record SUM for such a special
combination.
ForthedesignationTITL32charactersareavailable. Theinputdesignationcanhave,however,
only 28 characters, because the program uses automatically 4 characters for an information
about the superposition at the beginning of the designation.
Definition of the load lase number:
Only one resulting load case can be defined at item LC for a standard combination with de-
termination of sums. All superposition results are stored in this load case. It is not allowed
to define a base load case number BASE in record COMB for the standard combination (only
BASE 0 is possible).
Output extent:
In addition to the default TABU YES in record ECHO, the extended output can be additionally
selected with ECHO FULL FULL or ECHO LOAD,FACT. A selection of individual elements
or the printout of the relevant values is not possible. For this purpose, the output of lists is
recommended in the Result Viewer.

CSAV Saving of a new combination number (1 - 999) − -
The determined load cases with their factors are
saved in a new load case combination.
With the use of command TRAC, it is possible to trace a Combination and retrieve detailed
information on how a resulting Load Case has been generated, as an outcome of a MAXiMA
superposition. Morespecifically,thisfeaturewilldiscoverandprintoutalltheinputLoadCases,
associated with a Combination, with their corresponding factors, that have been determined
by MAXiMA. This is especially useful in order to investigate, after a superposition has been
performed, how a critical Load Case on a specific element has been generated.
The required input parameters are the number of the resulting Load Case of interest, as well
as the element type and number. For BEAM elements, X position must be specified too, and,
in case a Load Case refers to cross section stresses (SIG / TAU), a stress point must be
entered in parameter SELE, analogously to the corresponding parameters of SUPP record.
Parameter SELE may be also used to specify a group number for nodes on QUAD or BRIC
elements (QNOD / BNOD). For boundary elements (BOUN) a node number has to be input
for the relevant boundary with SELE. Finally, with parameter OPT it is possible to control the
depthofthetracing,ie. ifintermediatesuperpositionsshouldberesolvedtooortracingshould
stop on the first level of detected input Load Cases.
Using the above parameters, the corresponding SUPP and COMB information, which were
originallyusedduringthesuperpositionthatgeneratedthespecifiedLoadCase,willbeinitially
read from the database. With this information available, it is subsequently possible to retrieve
the associated input Load Cases, with their corresponding factors that have been used in
the superposition. In case the detected result type is stored in the database, as is in most
circumstances, TRAC will attempt to validate that the superposition result computed during
tracing matches to what has been actually stored in CDB, during the superposition. However,
incaseofresulttypescomputedon-the-fly,suchasstressesonstresspointsofBEAM’scross
sections, or Von Mises stresses for QUAD elements, this is not possible.
Hint
Tracing must be performed in an individual MAXiMA run, as it cannot co-exist with the
standard superposition functionality.
Currently it is not possible to trace superpositions associated with Tendon Stresses for
Quad Elements.
The determined load cases and their factors are save in a new load case combination with
the input of a combination number for CSAV. Afterward the loads for a new load case can be
generatedwiththesavedcombinationfactorsintheprogramSOFiLOAD.Forthisthecombina-
tion number and the combination type COMB have to be input in record COPY of the program
SOFiLOAD. This new load case can still be used e.g. in a calculation with the program ASE.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-65MAXIMA|InputDescription
Hint
The transformation of load cases which are saved with CSAV into loads with SOFiLOAD
is only possible for initial load cases which contain ’real’ loads. Initial load cases whose
internal forces or other results are used in the superposition and which are not based on
’real’ loads are not considered whilst saving of the new combination. They get a warning
in the program SOFiLOAD.
Following superposition results can not transformed into loads:
• Difference load cases from CSM construction stage (consideration in ASE with group
control)
• Internal froces from modal analyses (workflow earthquake)
• Results from calculation of eigenvalues
• Results from calculation with time-step-method
The results of CSAV should be checked if a group control was used.. It is recommended
tousedCSAVonlyinthecaseoftheconsiderationofallgroupsinthepreviouscalculation
and superposition.
Example:
With the following input the determined load case combinations are saved as combination 55
and 56 for the node 12 for the superposition results max PZ and min PZ:
PROG MAXIMA
HEAD ...
TRAC LC 2155 ETYP NODE ELEM 12 OPT 'IF' CSAV 55
TRAC LC 2156 ETYP NODE ELEM 12 OPT 'IF' CSAV 56
END
With the program SOFiLOAD the two new load cases 201 and 202 which contain these load
case combinations are generated:
PROG SOFILOAD

COPY 55 COMB
LC 202 TYPE NONE

4.1 General Information
For the user of SSD it is possible to define the superposition inputs interactive.
In the SSD there is the task Combination Rules on the one hand and to the second the task
Superpositioning for Combination Rules.
The task Combination Rules define the superposition kind.
WiththetaskSuperpositioningforCombinationRulestheuserdefineswhichmaximumand/or
minimumvaluesofaspecificscalarvariableforanelementtypewhichistobeinputshouldbe
determined. The quantity of output can be specified additionally.
The task Superpositioning for Combination Rules can be inserted repeatedly in the SSD. So it
is possible for example to realize an intermediate superposition.
The input possibilities depend on the design code and the static system which were selected
at the beginning of the input process.
Forthecombinationsandsuperpositionareasonabledefaultisgeneratedfromtheinformation
of the database according to the used design code (INI file).
The Name of combinations and superpositions is generated automatically. However, it is pos-
sible to modify this definition according to the user requests. Here is to be considered, that
the preset Name begins with a blank. This blank must be deleted for manual modifications,
because otherwise the program sets the default again.
4.2 Combination Rules
The definition of the combinations with the respective actions and the relevant load cases is
done in the task Combination Rules or in the registry card Combination Rules. The input of
the actions is not necessary for superpositions without actions (e.g. according to German DIN
1045 old).
4.2.1 Superposition with Actions
Combinations with actions and relevant load cases are to be defined for the input of superpo-
sitions with actions.
Definition of the Combinations (corresponds to MAXIMA record COMB)
With the command
Insert new element ⇒ Combination Rule
a new combination rule is selected. The following preselection of the combination rules
is available:
Insert standard combination rule
for all design codes availalbe, includes at Superposition Kind the Standard superposition

ForthispurposetheNumberandtheNamemaybemodifiedoppositethedefault. Thepreset
combinations of the INI files are generated with number 100 and following.
The combination rule (formula) for the superposition is defined at Superposition Kind. The
combination rules are selectable here in dependence on used design code according to the
record COMB:
Standard superposition corresponds to COMB STAN
for the ultimate limit state:
ULS fundamental combination corresponds to COMB DESI
ULS accidental combination corresponds to COMB ACCI
leading variable action ψ1,1*Qk,1
ULS seismic combination corresponds to COMB EARQ
for the serviceability limit state:
SLS quasi-permanent combination corresponds to COMB PERM
SLS characteristic combination corresponds to COMB RARE
SLS frequent combination corresponds to COMB FREQ
SLS infrequent combination corresponds to COMB NONF
for simplified superpositions according to German DIN 18800 and other ones
ULS fundamental simplified corresponds to COMB DESI-V
ULS accidental simplified corresponds to COMB ACCI-V
(only for German DIN 18800 and Austrian OENORM B 4300)
SLS charact. (rare) simplified corresponds to COMB RARE-V
for non-linear calculated load cases
Choose non-linear Extrema corresponds to COMB NONL
for a userdefined combination
Explicitely defined combination corresponds to COMB EXPL
A subsequent modification of an Explicitely defined combination into another Superposition
4-2 SOFiSTiK2023InteractiveVersioninSSD|MAXIMA
kind (e.g. design fundamental combination) is only possible, if no action groups are used for
thedefinitionofactions. Usingactionsamodifcationispossible,however,theindicatedfactors
for the actions have to be checked by the user.
It follows the definition of the type of the result load cases at Type of resulting loadcases
(corresponds to TYPE record COMB). For design codes with superposition with safety factors
and combination coefficients the result load cases can be assigned here to the kinds of
superposition according to ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state (except for the
simplified superpositions):
ULS fundamental combination
ULS accidental combination
ULS seismic combination
SLS quasi-permanent combination
SLS characteristic combination
SLS frequent combination
SLS infrequent combination

Long term combination
Middle term combination
Short term combination
Very short term combination
for accidental combination fire
ULS fire combination
FurthermoreallactionsdefinedintheLoadcaseManagerorinSOFiLOADareavailableforall
design codes. With no Type the result load cases do not get a type.
Using a simplified superposition (e.g. according to German DIN 18800 or Austrian OENORM
4300) following types of the result load cases are preset:
Superposition kind Type of resulting loadcases
ULS fundamental simplified ULS fundamental combination
ULS accidental simplified ULS accidental combination
SLS charact. (rare) simplifed SLS characteristic combination
It follows the input of the load case numbers for the load cases to be generated at Numbers of
resulting loadcases. Three possibilities for the definition of the result load case numbers are
planned here:

The defaults for the result load case numbers are selected - corresponds to case 3 described
in record SUPP: BASE in record COMB and LC in record SUPP not input. If a design code
for which different defaults of the base load case numbers are available in the INI file is used,
then the load case numbers are considered according to the definition in the INI file. An input
of the First Loadcase No. at Superposition commands is not possible.

of the result load case number are determined via the default at Superposition Commands ⇒
First Loadcase No. The procedure corresponds to case 1 described in record SUPP: BASE in
record COMB input and LC in record SUPP not input. Thus an input of the First Loadcase No.
at Superposition commands is not possible.

The first freely optional load case number is input at Superposition Commands ⇒ First Load-
case No. If some result load cases are generated, than the load case numbers are numbered
continuously. The numbers 100 to 999999 can be defined as result load case numbers.

to which action of the selected superposition equation the input action belongs. Following
possibilities are available for Kind of action:

Definition of the Load Cases (corresponds to MAXIMA record LC)
With the command
Insert new element ⇒ Loadcase
the load cases which appertain to an action are defined. The button Loadcase is not
selectable in the case of a definition of an userdefined combination (Explicitely defined
Combination). The load cases are allocated automatically to the action group or to the action
from the datebase information.
The load cases which are available in the database and which appertain to a before defined
action are shown at Loadcase. All load cases which are available for this action are selected
withNumber 0andAllloadcaseswithsametypeastheaction. Onlytheloadcaseswhich
are a part only of the relevant category are selected with Number -1 and All loadcases of
the same category. A detailed explanation is available in record LC of the MAXIMA input.
However, one or more load cases can be selected by marking for this action.
The selected load case number is announced at Number. Also load case numbers which are
available in the database and which were assigned to another action as the selected one can
be input here.
The Name of the load case is taken over from the definitions in the database. It can not be
modified here.
At Loadcase type it is defined, how the load case is considered for the combination (corre-
sponds to MAXIMA record LC TYPE). The default depends on the definitions at the actions,
which was input in the Loadcase Manager - Actions or in SOFiLOAD (corresponds to record
ACT item SUP). If Choose nonlinear Extrema was selected at Combination rule - Super-
position kind, the load cases must get the Load case type - add the most unfavourable
always (AG1-AG99)!
Modifications of the load case types are only temporarily processed in MAXIMA. That
means these inputs are only considered in this MAXIMA calculation. The default from
theLoadcaseManager-ActionsorfromSOFiLOAD(correspondstorecordACTSUP)is
overlaid then! In case of doubt it is recommended to use the default from the Loadcase
Manager or from SOFiLOAD and not input explicitly a load case type.
Following load case types are possible:
add always (G,perm)
add if unfavourable (Q)
add with unfavourable sign (W)
add the most unfavourable always (AG1-AG99)
add the most unfavourable (A1-A99)
add the most unfavourable with unfavourable sign (X1-X99)
add always with individual factors (G,perc)
additional contributing loadcase (F) (not for the first load case of an action)
Here it means:
4-8 SOFiSTiK2023InteractiveVersioninSSD|MAXIMA
• add the most unfavourable always (AG1-AG99) - Only the most unfavourable load
case of a permanent alternative load case group is determined and added.
• add the most unfavourable (A1-A99) - The most unfavourable load case of the
alternative load case group is determined and it is only added, if it acts unfavourably.
• addthemostunfavourablewithunfavourablesign(X1-X99)-Themostunfavourable
load case of the alternative load case group is determined with changing sign and it is

• additional contributing loadcase (F) - The contributing load case is added to the load
case which was defined before (main load case) and both load cases are superimposed
together, however only, if the main load case has a part for the superposition ⇒ record
LC.
If add the most unfavourable always (AG1-AG99), add the most unfavourable (A1-A99)
or add the most unfavourable with unfavourable sign (X1-X99) was selected at Loadcase

IfforElementtype-Nodesatareaelements orNodesatvolumeelements weredefined,a
group for which the superposition should be done can be selected then at Group number by
deleting of the tick at All groups. The default is ALL for all groups.
If groups should be defined for other element types, it has to be done via Output - Startnum-
ber, Endnumber, Increment. If the result load case does not exit yet, the superposition is
done here for the elements of all groups, but only the selected elements are output then.
Selection of a Cross Section Point for Beams
