1 General
1.1 Task Description
AQUA calculates the properties of cross sections of any shape and made out of any material.
The cross section properties for a static analysis are determined, as well as characteristic
magnitudesforthecalculationofnormalandshearstresses. Crosssectionsneedtobedefined
before input of the static system or the dimensioning with AQB.
After definition with AQUA, the cross sections can be represented graphically with Re-
sultViewer.
1.2 Types of sections
1.2.1 Static Properties of Cross Sections
All static properties of cross sections are directly specified. This includes shear deformation
areas and stress resistance values. The values may be taken from other cross sections with
a multiplication factor. These cross sections are mainly used in the static calculations. Their
usage in AQB is strongly restricted.
1.2.2 Standard Cross Sections
A standard cross section (Rolled steel shapes, Rectangle, T-beam, annular sections, cables)
isalwaysdefinedwithasinglecommand. Allcrosssectionalproperties,includingthetorsional
moment of inertia, are available. Due to the known geometric structure, most of the property
valuesmaybecalculatedinadirectway,allowingtoskipthetimeconsumingdetailedanalysis
of the shear or plastic resistance only available with an AQUA license. In many cases it is
also intended to have these simpler values taken from tabulated data in the literature. On the
other side variability and locations of design points are thus limited. A detailed analysis or a
combination with other cross section parts is only possible for the rolled steel shapes.
ThusallothersectionsdonotallowneitherthecalculationofvonMisesstressesnorthedesign
for fatigue.
1.2.3 Freely Defined Thin-walled Cross Sections
A freely defined thin-walled cross section may contain any number of thin elements, whose
thickness is much smaller comparative to its length. A thin element assumes that the variation
of the normal stress and most shear stresses over the thickness are negligible. This has the
consequencethatthemomentofinertiaabouttheweakaxisalsovanishes. Availableelements
are panels, standard steel shapes and welded joints, as well as reinforcements.
Sectionmoduliforallstressesareavailableatallpointsofthecrosssection. Torsionalmoment
of inertia and warping resistance, as well as centre of shear and shear deformation areas, are
determined for open or closed shapes, but they can also be specified explicitly for special
cases. Composite cross sections can be defined.

1.2.4 Freely Defined Solid Cross Sections
Afreelydefinedsolidcrosssectionconsistsofanynumberofouterandinnerperimetersinthe
form of circles or polygons, as well as of reinforcement elements. Structural steel shapes can
be integrated.
Section moduli for all stresses are only available at distinct points of the cross section. The
torsionalmomentofinertia,thecentreofshearandthesheardeformationareascanbecalcu-
lated, or they can be input separately. The warping resistance can not be determined. Com-
posite sections or effective widths of the polygons can be defined.
1.2.5 Freely Defined FE Cross Sections
A freely defined FE cross section will be imported from a FE mesh available in a separate
external data base. Stress points, reinforcement elements or shear cuts may be added then.
The import may also activate a temperature field for the section (e.g. hot design).
Allsectionalvaluesincludingwarpingareevaluated. Sectionmoduliforallforcesandmoments
are available for all element mid points. Composite sections may be defined.

section requires a continua solution. This means that the simplifications of the thin walled
approach allow a faster, more robust and more extensive solution, but neglects local effects,
which may become visible within a continua solution with integral equations or finite elements.
Forexampleitistobenoted,thatforathinhollowbox,theshearstressofthecontinuasolution
is not really constant across the web thickness and may have higher intensities at the corners
which might require a smoothing of the contour. On the other side a thin walled section has
problems to take account of the positive effect of the fillets of a thin rolled steel shape which
has a considerable contribution to the torsional strength.

1.3 Creating variants of sections
Duetothefactthatmostcrosssectionsarebuildupaccordingtocertainrules,AQUAsupplies
several definition possibilities for these instances:
• You may describe the section via CADINP variables within a block, which is then used
multiple times.
• You may interpolate between two sections linearly
1-2 SOFiSTiK2023General |AQUA
• You can define a cross section template consisting of several construction points. Other
points are referenced hierarchically to those original points. You can then generate other
cross sections by changing these points.
• You may describe the position of those construction points by a 3D model with curved
reference lines.
It is also possible for AQUA to update all interpolated or otherwise generated sections with a
single command (INTE).

2 Theoretical Principles
2.1 Materials
Propertiesofmaterialsmustbedistinguishedaccordingtowhethertheyaretobekeptasclose
aspossibletorealvalues(e.g. fordynamiccalculations)ortobeusedwithasafetycoefficient
for calculating an ultimate load-bearing capacity.
A small, but subtle contradiction is given by the fact, that many design codes use a factor of
10.0 to convert the density of a material (cid:2)t/m3(cid:3) to the weight (cid:2)kN/m3(cid:3) . The US customary
unitsusethepoundasbaseunit,themassesareconvertedwithanominalvalueofthegravity
acceleration.
To avoid any confusion and to use all the benefits of the SI-System SOFiSTiK has established
the following rules:
• All specified weights have to be specified in (kN/m3) or (b/ƒt3), but they are saved as
masses to the data base. Thus a direct definition of the mass with a unit of (kg/m3) or
(bm/ƒt3) is also possible.
• Masses for dynamic or densities for thermal analysis will be always determined directly
from that data.
• If the design code or the user allows for more precise loadings, the user may specify the
true value of the gravity acceleration for the reference location with the NORM record.
Somehow confusing, there is an additional density value of the raw material. This value is
relevant for many physical properties of concrete or timber, but its value is less than the value
used for self weight.
Whereas the safety factors were formerly assigned more-or-less at random, sometimes to the
load and sometimes to the material, more recent regulations (Eurocode) provide a clearer
separation between safety factors for the loads and factors for the material.
Since the material safety factors still depend on the nature of the load or the type of design,
AQUA generates and stores only the genuine properties of the material. However, AQUA
accountsforsomesafetyfactorswhichareindependentoftheparticularloadingcase,suchas
long term reduction factors.
Nevertheless, a safety coefficient can be entered in AQUA for each material; this is used in
AQUA for calculating the full plastic section forces and moments, and can be used in AQB for
the strain checks.
2.2 Holes and Composite Sections
Any type of hole will be generated automatically if polygons or circles overlap. A true hole is

”in front of” and will create a hole in the area laying behind.
2.3 Coordinate System
Cross sections are described according to DIN 1080 in the local y-z coordinate system of the
beam. Here the x-axis points in the longitudinal direction of the bar. The observer is looking in
general at the positive boundary of the section (from the end of the bar to the beginning).
The coordinate system of the section is identical with the local beam coordinate-system, i.e.
thelocalx-axisisalongthebeamonthelinebetweenthenodes,they-andthez-axisareright
handed perpendicular to it. The z-axis defines the main bending direction and is in general
oriented downwards in the gravity direction.
For the description of the forces and moments and the support conditions, three points along
the beam have to be distinguished within a section:
• Centreofgravity(G)-Thisisthephysicalmeaningofcentreandisusedforthecalculation
of the self weight and masses.
• Elastic reference (S) - This is the centre weighted with the elasticity modulus of the gross
section. For homogeneous material it is identical with the centre of gravity, thus often just
named ”centre”. This value may include the minimum reinforcements.
• Elasticcentre(N)-Thisisthemechanicalpointwherethenormalforceisacting. Stresses
induced by a constant strain within the total section will not generate any moments refer-
ence to that point. It differs from the elastic centre by the inclusion of holes and the current
reinforcements. Quite often it is also called the centre of the net or ideal section.
• Effective bending centre (B) - If some parts of the section do not take fully part due to
shear deformations, this may be accounted for bei noneffective areas for bending. This
has the consequence, that the bending strains and stresses are relative to the effective
centre. As a moment can be freely moved around, no additional forces are introduced by
this operation.
• Shear centre (M) - This point may be defined in several ways: A shear force acting at this
point does not create torsion. A section with torsion will rotate about this point. Thus if an
explicit rotation axis should be described, this point has to be defined explicitly.
• Beam axis - The beam axis is the (straight) connection between the beam nodes. The
section of the beam have to be defined at a specific location in the system, to allow the
correct treatment of all eccentricities. The sectional point on the beam axis is preferred to
be the origin of the sectional coordinate system (beam with reference axis). Alternatively
the elastic center may be used instead.
Hint
– Hinges are always defined at the elastic centre or shear centre.
– Enforced rotational axis must coincide with the beam axis.
Differencesbetweenthesepointswillcreatechangesintheforcesandmoments. Ontheother
side it is possible to describe a complete geometry with any eccentricities and unsymmetrical
haunched beams and construction stages with ease.

Sections will be saved in the database with the periphery in that same orientation. The sign of
the radius of a circular arc is defined positive if the area is increased compared to the secant,
and it is negative if the area is decreased as in the case of a fillet.
2.4 Normal Stresses
The load-bearing behaviour of a generic bar without foundation according to the 1st order
theory, yet with warping, can be described with a differential equation matrix:

m  torsional load
The rest of the parameters are static properties of the cross section (geometrical area mo-
ments). Since it is impractical to incorporate all of the static properties into the calculation,
certain standardisations are normally adopted:
• The axial force refers to the elastic centre of the beam, i.e.
Fy=Fz=0 (2.2)
• Bending takes place about the principal axes, i.e.
Fyz=0 (2.3)
• Warping can occur freely in the cross section, i.e.
F=0 (2.4)
• The torsional moment and the shear forces refer to the centre of shear, i.e.
Fy=Fz=0 (2.5)
Conversely,theconditionsin2.2through2.5canbeusedindeterminingtheelasticcentre,the
orientation of the principal axes, the free moduli of warping and the centre of shear.
The determination of the area moments is relatively simple and shall not be described in any
further detail.
The normal stresses of a bar cross section can be described by means of Swain’s expression
and the normalized warping:
N (cid:0)M  +M  (cid:1) (cid:0)M  −M  (cid:1) M

y z yz y z yz
2.5 Effective Width
The so-called effective widths are used for modeling the effects which derive from the di-
aphragm action of the plate of a T-beam or a box cross section. The concept of an equivalent
substitute width with constant normal stress naturally demands different approaches depend-
ing on the task at hand (statics, design).
Effective width are also used for metallic sections of class 4, where parts of the section buckle
and do not allow any longitudinal stress.
AQUAisabletodefinethenon-effectiveareasbymeansofrectangularregionswithselectable
effectivity for different forces or moments. AQUA then stores the cross section values for the
total cross section as well as for the effective cross section.
Static analysis usually refers to the stiffness of the effective parts, whereas the normal force
(e.g. prestressing) refers to the center of the total cross section.
2-4 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQUA
For the design the stresses from the normal force on the total section are then combined with
stresses from the bending moments on the effective section.
The non effective parts remain effective for shear stress calculations due to many consistency
reasons. But as the longitudinal stress is zero, the shear stress is always constant within an
element.
2.6 Warping and Shear Stresses
Incaseofwarpingduetotorsion(primaryorsecondary)andshearforce,thecrosssectionno
longerremainsplane. Adeflectionoccurringatthecrosssectioninthelongitudinaldirection
induces shear stresses.
All the problems of the elasticity theory can be analysed by use of the force method or the
displacement method. While the force method is frequently used in calculations by hand, the
displacement method is better suited for processing with the computer. Both procedures are
implemented in AQUA for solid cross sections. The latter are by default computed by means
of the displacement method and in particular the Finite Element Method (FEM). Alternatively,
the Boundary Element Method (BEM) could be also activated. Certain simplifications of the
followingequationscanbemadeincaseofthin-walledsectionswhichfacilitateaquicksolution

A general formulation for the cross section warping  according to the displacement method
conforms to the equilibrium condition

and the boundary condition

τ z =G· +y· (2.9b)

The right side of 2.7 can be computed for example by 2.6. Assuming constant normal force
and constant cross section properties, one gets:

y z yz y z yz
These equations will be approximated by AQUA either with the Boundary Element Method
(BEM) or the Finite Element Method (FEM).
For the Saint Venant’s torsion problem (∂Θ /∂ = 1) the right side of 2.7 is identical to zero
SOFiSTiK2023 2-5AQUA|TheoreticalPrinciples
and the following boundary condition applies:
∂
= z· n y − y · n z . (2.11)
∂n
2.7 Torsional Moment of Inertia
The torsional moment of inertia according to the displacement method  t is derived by
(cid:90) (cid:90)
(cid:148) y2+z2−(∂/∂y)2−(∂/∂z)2(cid:151)
 t = dF (2.12)
As long as AQUA does not solve the differential equation 2.7, only an estimate of the torsional
momentofinertiaispossible. Thelastequationshowsthatthepolarmomentofinertiacanbe
substituted for  t in case of warp-free cross sections
 t ≤  p =  y +  z. (2.13)
For all cross sections Eq. 2.13 provides an upper limit, which e.g. is about 10% above the
exact value for a square.
A better approximation is given by Saint Venant:
A4
 T = (cid:2)4 · π2 · (cid:0) +  (cid:1)(cid:3) (2.14)
y z
This value is exact for circular and elliptical cross sections. For compact solid cross sections
this value provides a good approximation.

section based on the external and internal perimeters is used for a more refined estimate.

2.8 Shear Stresses in Solid Sections
The calculation of shear stresses for solid sections in AQUA requires that the user specifies
the method to be used and the positions that have to be checked. This challenging problem
2-6 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQUA
can be solved with a variety of methods, which is controlled by the CTRL option STYP:
CTRL STYP FEM Finite Element Method - for all shear related cross-sectional prop-
erties (default)

database containing the section mesh in a subfolder

CTRL STYP FORC Force Method
Hint
The default of version 2014 can be set with CTRL STYP BEM.
In post-cracking (state II) analysis, AQB always employs the force method with proportional
axial force. In case of composite cross sections options BEM 2 and BEM 3 should be used
with caution. The input of explicit shear sections is required as a rule.
2.8.1 Finite Element Method
Basics
The Finite Element Method for solid (thick) sections is an innovative approach which uses a
2D discretisation of the cross-sectional domain, thus formulating the main differential warping
problem into a discrete system of equations using the connectivity of the mesh (AQUA pro-
duces only quadrilateral ”QUAD” meshes). AQUA solves the four main unit warping problems
(M T1 = 1.0, V y = 1.0, V z = 1.0 and M T2 = 1.0) and derives from that the unit shear stress
distributions resulting under each loading condition. These results are then being used for
obtaining several entities such as:
•  T torsional resistance (for primary torsional moment M T1)
• C m warping resistance (for bi-moment M b)
• C ms warping shear resistance (for secondary torsional moment M T2)
• A y shear deformation area in the y-direction (for V y)
• A z shear deformation area in the z-direction (for V z)
• A yz shear deformation area in the yz-plane
• y sc , z sc location of the shear centre
•  mn ,  m minimum and maximum warpings
• higher quantities such as A y, A z, A yy, A zz, r y, r z
(required for second order analysis)
SOFiSTiK2023 2-7AQUA|TheoreticalPrinciples
Hint
The Finite Element Method is the default method of computation in version 2016 for all
polygonal thick cross-sections.
Ifnecessary,onecouldswitchtoanyoftheremaininganalysismethodsbymeansoftheCTRL
option prior to the definition of a cross-section or in the cross-section editor.
It is also worth noting that cross-sections defined in version 2014 when reopened in version
2016 will automatically be converted by default to FEM cross-sections with the following con-
version scheme:
CTRL STYP 0 ⇒ CTRL STYP FORC
CTRL STYP 1 to 3 ⇒ CTRL STYP FEM
CTRL STYP 15 ⇒ CTRL STYP FEMX
CTRL STYP 5 ⇒ CTRL STYP BEM 1
CTRL STYP 6 ⇒ CTRL STYP BEM 2
CTRL STYP 7 ⇒ CTRL STYP BEM 3
General Advantages
The Finite Element Method has several numerical and performance-related advantages over
the methods previously available in AQUA:
• provides a more stable and accurate approach for the elastic computation of torsional,
shear force and warping dependent properties and stresses
• provides a nonlinear incremental approach for the computation of plastic and other
nonlinear properties. FEM yields plausible values for the plastic shear forces and the
plastic torsional moment
• providesamoreaccurateestimationoftheelasticlimitforces N e, M y,e, M z,e, M b,e for
general cross-sections
• allows the direct computation of arbitrary geometry and complexity of hot sections with
HYDRA (thermal time-dependent analysis)
• provides symmetrical meshing of singly or doubly symmetrical cross-sections, thus en-
suring that symmetry of results is maintained and reduces numerical fluctuations of
derivatives (centroid, shear centre, points of symmetrical warping etc.)
• enables a detailed visualization of stresses and warpings with WINGRAF / Result
Viewer over the entirety of the domain
As with the remaining methods, one can also define none-effective parts, various isotropic /
anisotropic material models, shear cuts, reinforcements and construction stages which shall
be taken into account when constructing and meshing, interpolating, computing and post-
processing the model.
Secondary CDB
Upon activating the extended control option CTRL STYP FEMX the generated cross-sectional
meshshallbesavedintoadatabankwhichislocatedinasubdirectorypertainingtotheproject,
2-8 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQUA
entitled projectname_sections. For example, Section 1 would then be saved in the following
database: projectname_sections\section_0001.cdb. The created database is an important
featurewhichisnecessaryforHYDRAifthesectionistobelateronusedinathermalanalysis
or in a column design. It is not recommended to activate this option unless one is explicitly
interestedinthephysicaloutputdetailsoftheanalysisasitscreationmaydemandconsiderable
additionalHDDspaceandwritingtime. Outofoptimizationreasons,thedefaultsettingisCTRL
STYP FEM ensuring that the mesh for each cross-section shall be created and kept only for
the period of the analysis.
Databases with meshes could be also imported into AQUA using the SECT FEM definition for
a freely defined cross-section. The user is also allowed to import sectional systems meshed
by SOFiMSHC 2D as a whole or group-wise via the same principle.
Graphical Results Output
If the input option SECT LTAU is defined by the user, WINGRAF could access the secondary
CDB containing the mesh and visualize the therein saved unit shear stresses over the entire
domainofthecross-section. Thefourunitshearstressprofiles(M T1 =1.0,V y =1.0,V z =1.0

The Animator could be used for a general graphical overview too. For most general pur-
poses, the Result Viewer would always extract the boundary warpings/stresses along those
quad edges belonging to the outer contours of the domain and save them in the main project
database, ready for visualization under the tree.
Hint
Explicitly defined stress points and single reinforcement bars shall not necessarily be
meshedinsuchawaythatAQUAwillalwayscreateaFEnodeatthoselocations. There-
fore results at those points are usually obtained via interpolation of results belonging to
the surrounding quads.
Mesh Quality
The quality of the FEM analysis depends entirely on how fine the underlying model is to be
discretized, i.e. the number of quad elements the mesh consists of. By default, AQUA aims at
providing a sufficiently reasonable mesh in order to obtain mechanically reasonably accurate
results for all cross-sectional elastic and plastic values, especially for steel shapes. One has
to however note that the last requirement is very difficult to be fulfilled for any possible input. It
is also a matter of compromise between accuracy, computational time and demand. More ge-
ometrically complex and involving, especially multi-domain / multi-material composite sections
might need further mesh densification in the zones of stress concentration, interfaces and fil-
lets. Same applies to sections which are to be subsequently undergoing thermal analysis with
HYDRA, where acceptable results can only be obtained with finer meshes. Before meshing a
model, AQUA determines for each subregion of the domain a corresponding mesh size which
is to be applied, also termed ”h-value”.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-9AQUA|TheoreticalPrinciples
Hint
The cross-sectional FE-mesh provided by AQUA using the default mesh parameters is
in most cases sufficient to obtain mechanically reasonably accurate results of all cross-
sectional elastic and plastic values.
Forthecaseswhereadenseroracoarsermeshisrequiredonanoveralllevel,acontroloption

applies the quotient as a factor on that region.

the program to rescale it to the nearest extreme and yield a warning.
Itismorethanrecommendedtousethefirstoptionsinceanestimateofthe”h-values” isquite
cumbersome and is a function of several complex invariable criteria.
Hint
Reducing the mesh could result in overwhelmingly long analysis time, large databases
and excessive data output.
In order to avoid various meshing problems, one should bear in mind that polygons must not
intersect each other at one or more singular points. It is thoroughly possible for polygons to
intersect each other in various fashions, provided that the intersections are continuous and
generated intersection points are not singular points.
Integration Schemes
When integrating any FE-related properties, AQUA/AQB would always employ a Lobatto-
integration scheme. For some very special cases, further integration schemes are available
using CTRL SINT. The options are :
1 Integration scheme using only quad mid points (useful for fine meshes)
2 Integration scheme using only quad nodes
3 Lobatto-integration scheme with nodes and quad mid-points (default)

Advanced FEM analysis
The FEM method also allows for several far more complex effects such as plasticity to be
considered by the analysis of a cross-section:
1. CTRL OPT PLAS
The analysis of the shear related plastic properties (M T1,p, V y,p , V z,p, M T2,p) for thick
(solid)FEMcross-sectionsisacomplextask,especiallyifthesevaluesaretobecomputed
in a mechanically exact manner. It should be noted that in real engineering applications,
shear does not exist on its own and plastic values, required for interaction purposes and
checks, are often of controversial nature and in many cases it is recommended to refer to
standard tabulated values. There is a handful of resources on the topic, but it is in nearly
all the cases left to the engineer to take an adequate decision as to which plastic forces
and moments would mostly suit the nature of his needs. In order to allow for that, the
following three methods have been implemented into AQUA for CTRL OPT PLAS:
0 take all plastic values from standard cross-sectional tables

ment controlled FEM approach

It is of importance to note that:
• Standard steel (solid) profiles PROF obtain their plastic values by default directly from
section tables, if they are defined without SECT (default CTRL PLAS 0):
PROF 1 MNO 1 TYPE IPE 300
PROF 2 MNO 1 TYPE IPE 300 DTYP S
If SECT is given before PROF, the plastic shear values are also taken from section
tables (default CTRL PLAS 0)
SECT 3 MNO 1
PROF 3 TYPE IPE 300 DTYP S
However, with an explicit input of CTRL PLAS 1 or 2 the method of the determination
of the plastic shear values can be modified to FE-method.
• Freely defined sections with SECT obtain their plastic values by default according to
the method they are computed with:

handled by FEM with the enforced condition of using the standard method PLAS 1
(default if nothing else specified) in combination with the condition of using elastic

AQUAalsopossessesahighlyadvancedalgorithmforcalculatingtheplasticshear-related
properties using a non linear incremental displacement controlled FEM approach. The
latter consists in applying a unit kinematic deformation once at a time onto the cross-
section in its principal axis and gradually increasing that deformation until the ultimate
plastic capacity is reached, i.e. the tangential elasto-plastic stiffness does not change
significantly with increasing deformation. Full plastification does not necessarily mean
all of the Gauss points becoming plastic. The algorithm would currently find consecutive
elasto-plastic equilibrium states along the fundamental path and compute the resulting
plasticforce/moment,stiffness,residualsandincrementalwarping. Whenevertheiterative
increments are within small tolerances, the algorithm is deemed to have converged and
theplasticvaluesarewrittenintothedatabase. WPSshallcaterforcorrectguidingoutput
during the analysis. Both characteristic and design plastic values are being computed by
the algorithm. Non-effective parts and construction stages are being disregarded in the
analysis, i.e. converged plastic values are only applicable to the final cross-section.
The current implementation of the CTRL PLAS 2 plastic algorithm employs the von
2-12 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQUA
Mises2D plastic material model for isotropic/anisotropic steel and concrete materials (de-
fault) and the Tsai-Wu2D model for anisotropic timber-like materials under plastification.
Forvisualizationoftheplastifiedcross-sectionalareas(bymeansofWingraf),correspond-
ingsecondaryelementgroupsaregeneratedautomaticallyinthecross-sectiondatabase.
The latter are automatically created provided STEU PLAS 2, STEU STYP FEMX and the
additional option QNR LTAU are activated for the current cross-section. The naming con-
vention for the secondary groups is based on the literal of the computed plastic force,
extended by an identifier for the current state (fyd = design state, fyk = characteristic
state).
The example input below illustrates the activation of the advanced algorithm with the
forced condition of overwriting the computed plastic shear forces with the ones obtained
from the elastic shear areas.

Hint
Please note that CTRL PLAS 2 method is currently still under development. There-
foreitishighlyrecommendednottofullyrelyontheresultsitproduces,eventhough
the method is based on mechanically exact assumptions. Depending on the mesh
size and the complexity of the cross-section, analysis time might vary widely and
impede the computational speed of your project. Convergence is also not fully guar-
anteed under all circumstances.
Thermal FEM analysis
FEM cross-section of arbitrary shape and material composition can be easily used for time-
dependent thermal analysis with HYDRA. The user is kindly advised to consult the manual
of HYDRA and in particular the definitions of SECT and MEXT in AQUA for more detailed
information on the underlying workflow.
2.8.2 Boundary Element Method
TheanalysiswiththedisplacementmethodmaybealsodonewiththeIntegralequationmethod
(alsotermedBoundaryElementMethod)developedbyKatz[2]. Onlythecrosssectioncontour
isdiscretizedintomultipleso-called”boundaryelements”. Alinearformulationofthewarpingis
madeforeachelementandtheboundaryconditionissatisfiedbyaGalerkinweightedresidual.
The number of elements determines the accuracy of the solution. In the case of a square,
for instance, the unit lateral warping on all the axes of symmetry is zero. A non-vanishing
solution can therefore be obtained only by defining at least four elements per side. AQUA
uses each polygon edge as one element, which can be further subdivided depending on its
size. Duplicateedgesareautomaticallyremoved. Astheresultsalongtheedgeswillvaryonly
linearly, it is strongly recommended to use the input value CTRL HMIN or the item SMAX in
POLY in order to have a coarse subdivision visible.
Internally a finer subdivision is however needed. Since a finer subdivision increases the com-
putational time with a power of two or three, the subdivision should not be made too fine. The
user can control the mesh size as absolute or relative by CTRL HDIV / SDIV.
CTRL SDIV 0 No subdivision
SOFiSTiK2023 2-13AQUA|TheoreticalPrinciples
CTRL SDIV 1 maximum 1/2
CTRL SDIV 2 maximum 1/4
CTRL SDIV 3 maximum 1/8
CTRL SDIV 4 maximum 1/16
CTRL SDIV 5 maximum 1/32
etc.
Under no circumstances are the results of this method to be accepted uncritically. It is a
numerical approximate method. Local singularities of the shear stresses, such as those at
re-entrant corners for example, can generate rather high stresses.
2.8.3 Force Method
The force method is implemented in AQUA/AQB only for ”statically determinate”, i.e. simply
connected cross sections.
The shear force components are then calculated by the classic formula
V S
τ = · (2.15)
 b
However, each of the four initial values is inadequate in this formula:
• V is only valid for prismatic beams with constant normal force
• I has to be generalized with Swains formula
• For S the separated part of the cross section is not known for multiple connected sections.
• Shear stress does not need to be constant across the width b
The separated part of the cross section is defined on the positive side of a shear cut, which is
to the left of the cut’s direction for the positive face of the section. It is extremely important to
input the sections correctly, and especially to maintain their sequence.
For multiple connected cross sections, the difference of the normal stress is in equilibrium
only with the sum of all shear stress. Thus the user must either know the location of zero
shear stress or specify the distribution factors of the shear to the multiple segments of the cut.
Problematic are those where the modulus of the sectional part is very small.
Since in cracked sections the common usage is only based on the force method, these dis-
tribution values FVY and FVZ are needed in any case for reinforced concrete sections. The
displacementmethodallowshowevertoestablishreasonableestimatesformanycases. Then
the entering and leaving shear stresses have different signs but nearly the same value. Thus
very large distribution factors are obtained, even if the sum of these still should remain 1.0
Torsionalstressanalysisisnotelementaryevenfortheforcemethod(stressfunctionwithsoap
film analogy). The resistance areas for the torsional shear stresses are therefore prescribed
by two values per section. The first value defines the shear at mid-area (Bredt’s equivalent
section). The second value defines the increase along the cut.
2-14 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQUA
2.8.4 Equivalent Hollow Cross Sections
The shear is primarily defined by resistances for the shear stresses in variant locations. While
the old DIN 1045 relied on elastic stress values, most modern design codes use equivalent
mean stress values in an equivalent section.
The recommended width of the equivalent section is in general twice the distance of the re-
inforcement to the outer edge. If the width is small, the kernel area is larger an the required
reinforcementareasaresmaller. Howeverthecompressivestressintheconcreteislargerand
if the allowed limits are exceede, the user should specify a larger width explicitly.
For the design of an equivalent hollow section we have additional integral values:
• A mean torsional shear stress which, after being multiplied by the width of the partial sec-
tion, must be covered by reinforcement. This corresponds to a section modulus for the
shear flow.
• Ameaneffectivetransverseshearoraneffectivewidthtobemultipliedwiththeshearstress
atthemidoftheequivalenthollowsectiontoobtainthedesignshearflowfromshearforce.
To obtain these values in AQUA with CTRL STYP FEM/FEMX or BEM 2/3 the elastic shear
stresses are integrated over the total width. For a true hollow sections, this is the design value
directly, for an equivalent hollow section, the moment of the shear components is converted to
a constant shear flux across the width of the equivalent section (Figure 2.2).

reinforcement in a section, this value will be used to establish an upper limit on the torsional
shear flow.
The principal compressive stress will be calculated with the equivalent width from the design
shear flow.
2.8.5 Shear Cuts
The user normally uses the command CUT to define a so called cut through the sectional
geometry where a check of the shear stresses should take place. Each cut is assigned an
SOFiSTiK2023 2-15AQUA|TheoreticalPrinciples
identification, which consists of three characters. The cut can be defined parallel to an axis or
as a free form polygon line. Every segment has its own material number and it will only cut
through cross section elements with the same material number. Gaps between the segments
will be closed by means of virtual connections. The width of the substitute torsional cross
section is available as a special option for the description of equivalent hollow cross sections
of reinforced and prestressed concrete. Two partial cuts are generated for each section in this
case.
If the user does not supply any input, one or two axis-parallel cuts will be created through the
elastic centre. This is generally not sufficient even for a simple T-Beam, nor for composite
sections,wherethereferencematerialnumberofthesectionisnotnecessarilyrepresentedat
that location. The user will see a warning for general sections therefore.
CTRL SCUT allows the user to control how many of these standard cuts will be generated
(0/1/2).

The internal forces perpendicular to the cut M and N act in such way that positive axial forces
cause tensile stresses across the cut, and positive moments cause tensile stresses at the
End-Point.
Multiply connected cross section types require special considerations:
Similarlydifficultistheprocessingofcrosssectionsconsistingofseveralpolygons,eitherinner
perimeters or composite cross sections, not dissected by the polygonal shear cut. In such
cases AQUA examines all points of the polygon to see whether they are inside or on the
boundary of the already evaluated partial section. Openings must therefore always be defined
according to the polygons that surround them. In case of composite cross sections it may be
helpful to pay attention to the cut direction or the sequence of the polygons.
In the definition of cuts across several materials the user must take care that each segment of

Cuts through cross sections with ”open air” between their parts can not be analysed as the

number. This may happen especially with the standard cuts through the elastic centre.

2.9 Shear Stresses in Thin-Walled Sections
The calculation of shear stresses in thin walled sections is however much easier as opposed
to the shear analysis of solid continua. i.e. there are closed solutions possible which do not
depend on the subdivision of elements. The theoretical background has been developed and
published by Schade [3].
AQUA uses the deformation method in the frame of a simplified FE model for thin-walled sec-
tions in all cases. The CTRL option STYP has in here no effects at all, but you may specify
explicit values via SV.
2.10 Plastic forces
The calculation of fully plastic forces is a very complex task. The single values for each force
component may be evaluated easily, but the interaction of all forces and moments is a rather
extensive numerical problem. With AQUA/AQB one has the following choices:
• Estimates for standard sections
Plasticnormalforceandbendingmomentscanbeevaluatedprecisely. Fortheplasticshear
force V y,p the plastic shear area is taken according to Eurocode including the additional
fillet areas, which is a deviation from the simpler formulas given in DIN 18800 for steel
shapes. For V z,p the fillets are ignored. For M t,p a more conservative approximation
is used for thin walled sections, whereas for thick sections, the exact solution given by
Bäcklund/Akesson is used. It should be also noted that plastic forces and moments for
tabulated profiles shall always be transformed into the rotated system if the profiles are
rotated around their default state.
• Evaluation of plastic forces using the real geometry (AQUA - Full Version)
For thin walled sections of arbitrary shape and composition, the plastic normal force and
bending moments are evaluated precisely. Plastic shear forces V y,p, V z,p may be eval-
uated rather well (neglecting some plastic shear centre effects). The method that AQUA
currently uses for this purpose is based on scaling the elastic stresses to their yield limit,
which does in the general case provide a slight, but negligible overestimation of the exact
theoretical values, as in the case of M t,p.
For solid sections of arbitrary shape and composition, either computed by BEM or FEM,
the plastic normal force and bending moments are evaluated precisely. For torsion how-
ever, it is difficult in the very general case to clearly distinguish between open and closed
sections. For thick polygonal sections, a pure sum of areas would lead to significantly
overestimated values for all shear problems.
WithstandardBEM,aswellaswithFEMsolelyincombinationwithCTRLPLAS+16,AQUA
will use the shear deformation area for V y,p and V z,p, being up to 20% on the safe side.
IfstandardFEMisused(PLAS1),AQUAwillapplyascalingbasedontheelastictorsional
andshearstressinthesection,thuspartiallyoverestimatingbothtorsionalandshearplastic
values(seealsoSection2.8.1). Itisveryoftenquestionablehowthesevalues(inparticular
the plastic shear) compare to standard tabulated values. In reality, each resource uses a
slightly different mechanical definition of the area that is to be considered as fully plastic
and active. Nevertheless, using the PLAS 1 method is for design purposes adequate, safe
andcomputationallynotexpensive. Ifamechanicallycorrectanalysisissoughtafter,PLAS
2 method could be enforced to deliver the required, exact plastic values, but at the price of
2-18 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQUA
a higher computational cost (not recommended for a general use).
Finally, enforcing PLAS 0 for standard steel sections (also default in AQUA) is highly rec-
ommendable for design purposes.
• Evaluationofnonlinearinteractionvaluesfortherealcross-sectiongeometry(AQB-record

With this method, all prerequisites like compatibility, yield criteria and equilibrium are ful-
filled. Howevertheevaluationisalwaysdoneforadistinctforce/momentcombination. Thus
the limiting value has to be found iteratively.

3 Input Description
AQUA allows the user to define general cross sections with arbitrary geometry and materials.
Forsimplesectionsandmaterialsyoudonotneedaspeciallicense,butforallsectionsstarting
with record SECT you need a license for AQUA.
Before defining a section you have to specify the materials. Materials are addressed by an
arbitrary number. Please note, that by keeping track of construction phases in AQBS, it is
assumed that materials with higher material numbers were added at a later time.
A standard section is defined by just one input record. All sectional values will be calculated
includingtorsionalandshearproperties. Themaximumcomponentsforallstressesareknown,
but a detailed analysis at different locations within the section will not take place.
SVAL Sections without geometry
SREC Rectangular sections, plates, T-beams and joists
SCIT Circular and annular sections via Diameter / Thickness
TUBE Tubular sections
PROF Rolled Steel shapes
CABL Cable sections
SECT General section (AQUA licence required)
With AQUA cross sections can be redefined at any time during the processing of the project
withoutaffectingotherdefinedsections. Howeverifanymaterialdefinitionismade,allexisting
cross sections are deleted. The distributions of reinforcements and stresses are deleted too,
unless otherwise specified with CTRL REST.
Freely defined cross sections always start with the record SECT, which specifies the cross
section number. All subsequent input records describe this one cross section, which may
consist of several partial cross sections (external perimeter, inner perimeter, reinforcement
layout etc.). The input for a cross section is concluded either by the next SECT record or by
two END records.
3.1 Input Language
The input occurs in a free format with the CADINP input language (see the general manual
SOFiSTiK: ’Basics’).
3.2 Units
SOFiSTiK programs offer the possibility to carry out all input and output of data in engineering
units. A number of unit sets are provided for this purpose, which are preset according to
the design code used in the given project. This default can additionally be changed for each
program run separately using the keyword PAGE. More information about unit sets can be
found in the general SOFiSTiK manual, section ’Units’.
Three categories of units are distinguished:
mm Fixed unit. Input is always required in the specified unit.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-1AQUA|InputDescription
[mm] Explicit unit. Input defaults to the specified unit. Alternatively, an explicit as-
signment of a related unit is possible (eg. 2.5[m] ).
[mm] Implicit unit. Implicit units are categorised semantically and denoted by a cor-
1011
responding identity number (shown in green). Valid categories referring to the
unit ”length” are, for example, geodetic elevation, section length and thickness.
Thedefaultunitforeachcategoryisdefinedbythecurrentlyactive(designcode
specific) unit set. This input default can be overridden as described above. The
specified unit in square brackets corresponds to the default for unit set 5 (Eu-
rocodes, NORM UNIT 5).
Forsectionstheunitsforalldimesnionsareexpectedin[mm] ingeneral,theunitsets0,3and
4 expect [m] , the Unit-Set 1 [cm] . For reinforcement areas values are expected in [cm2] ,
the unit sets 6 and 7 expect [mm2] .
The following unit sets are provided:
0 = Standard units (m, kN, sec with some historic deviations)
1 = German buildings (sections in cm, system in m)
2 = German steel construction, (sections mm,cm2,dm4, system in m)
3 = Bridge construction (like 0 but internal forces in MN instead of kN)
4 = Soil Mechanics (m, kN, sec)
5 = Structural Engineering (sections in mm, system in m)
6 = Metric system (All dimensions in mm, loads in kN)
7 = Mechanical (All dimensions in mm, loads in N)
8 = U.S. Customary Units (AASHTO)
9 = U.S. Customary Units (ACI/AISC)
The default unit set (UNIT) of a corresponding design code is described in the record NORM
at the respective design code in the tables.

further. This can take place without problems only, if the assignment of the layers and the use
of the material numbers in the individual cross sections are not changed.

CTRL FACE defines the standard view on the section. While the physical orientation in space
isonlyspecifiedbytheorientationofthelocalbeamcoordinatesystem,thepossiblevaluesfor
graphical views on the section are defined that the literal POS and all positive numbers define
a view on the positive face (i.e. in the inverse direction of the beam or axis) while the literal
NEG and all negative values define a view on the negative face (ie. along the direction of the
beam or axis) :
POS y-axis to the left, z-axis downwards (default for AQUA)
NEG y-axis to the right, z-axis downwards (default for Cross Section Editor)
1,3 rotation by 0 or 180 degrees (y-axis horizontal)
2,4 rotation by 90 or 270 degrees (y-axis vertical)
>4 rotated against the default by VAl degrees
CTRL RFCS controls whether minimum reinforcement should be considered in the calculation
of the cross section values:
0 do not consider
1 do not consider for Boundary Element Method ("CTRL STYP BEM"), otherwise con-
sider for sections with more than one material (default)
2 consider for all sections (also for circular sections SCIT, but not for rectangular sec-
tions SREC)
3 consider also effect on dead load (the weight of the concrete should be reduced in
that case)
+4 do not assign reinforcement to any partial section
HMINdefinesamaximumallowedlengthforlinearorcircularpolygonedges. (Default: nolimit)
HTOL defines the maximum allowed stitch (error) of an approximation of a circular arc by a
polygon. This is applicable to fillets and arcs. Default is: 0.0035. There are two alternative
ways of defining an allowed stitch:
• HTOL factor [-] - define the stitch in the way that all circles will use the same angular
resolution,whichisnicerforvisualization. Butforasmallradiusbelow50mmtheangle
of the segments will be enlarged up to a factor of 6.
• HTOL stitch size [mm or m] - a direct input of a stitch size.

degrees.
HDIV defines a maximum element length for the boundary elements (BEM). In case of FE
cross-sections, HDIV shall be interpreted as mesh density scaling. There are two alternative
ways of applying a scale factor on the mesh density:
• HDIV factor [-] - for example a factor of 0.5 [-] would mean that each subdomain
is to be scaled down to 50% of its originally defined by AQUA mesh density. Same
effect could be achieved by the alternative input 50[%]. A factor greater than 1.0 [-] or
100[%] can be also applied.
• HDIV mesh size [mm or m] - a direct input of a global mesh size.
In this case AQUA determines the ratio of the input value to the internally computed
”region element size” and applies the quotient as a factor on that region.
Since the mesh size cannot be uncontrollably rescaled, AQUA has fixed allowable internal
limits in the range [0.1 ... 5.0] or [10% ... 500 %]. Any value inputted beyond this scope
forces the program to rescale it to the nearest extreme and yield a warning.
SDIV defines a relative desired element length per edge for the boundary elements. For finite
elements this should be kept to the default of 0 and if not so, the value will be ignored.
0 no explicit subdivision
1 maximum 1/2
2 maximum 1/4
3 maximum 1/8
4 maximum 1/16
5 maximum 1/32 (Default BEM)

bedefinedadditionallyatitemVAL2. ThevalueSDIV40.001defines1mm,assnapmeasure.
The detailed background of STYP and SCUT are explained in Section 2.8.
STYP controls the analysis of shear stresses in general solid sections:
STYP FEM Finite Element Method - for all shear related cross-sectional properties
(default)
STYP FEMX Finite Element Method as described above, but with a secondary
database containing the section mesh in a subfolder

STYP BEM 2 Boundary Element Method for torsion and Force Method for shear using

STYP BEM 3 Boundary Element Method for torsion, shear deformation areas are also
determined
STYP FORC Force Method
3-10 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
Hint
The default of version 2014 can be set with CTRL STYP BEM. However, for rectangular,
T-Beam and circular explicit concrete sections, the values Ay and Az must be set to 0.0
explicitly if required.
PLAS defines the method of plastic shear computation for FE solid sections:
0 take all plastic values from standard cross-sectional tables
1 compute plastic shear-related properties using a FE-method of scaling the elastic
shear stresses flux (default)
2 calculateplasticshear-relatedpropertiesusinganonlinearincrementaldisplacement
controlled FEM approach
+1*16 replace current method’s computed V y,p and V z,p by plastic forces based on
the scaled elastic shear areas
The controls are of high importance and one should be first familiar with their background.
Therefore the user is kindly advised to consult Sections 2.8 and 2.10 of the AQUA manual for
a detailed description of the control options and their peculiarities.
FORC defines the method of (plastic) limit forces computation:
- Computation of positive limit forces. Negative forces are computed if tensile
strength and compression strength are different or a negative normal force (com-
pression) was defined via ’SV NPLC’ (default)
TENS Only computation of positive limit forces (even if the strengths are different)
COMP Always computation of negative limit forces too (even if the strengths are equal)
By specifying the additional literal BUCK at item VAL2 it is possible to activate the
considering of buckling (reduction of cross section area) of thin walled elements
for a negative normal force -N (compression) or in the compression zone of the
bending moment My or Mz. Considering of buckling is not the default setting
because bracings are normally not applied in the design phase.
By specifying the additional literal GAM at item VAL3 it is possible to define the
material safety factor for the design forces via item VAL4:
- Material safety for cross sectional design (γ M0 of steel) (default)
M0 Material safety for cross sectional design (γ M0 of steel)
SCM Material safety for stability check
The material safety of single materials can be modified via the material records,
e.g. for γ M0 of a steel with ’STEE SCM0 ...’.

pl pl
in the codes SIA, AASHTO, DECRETO MINISTERIALE and so on. A composite section is
detected if there are only steel and concrete materials and if the reference material is a steel
material.
A concrete section is detected if the reference material is a concrete material. Then no plastic
limit forces are computed, except of in case of a ’hot’ design (temperatures from program
HYDRA), even if steel materials exists.
SINT controls for the type of FEM integration scheme:
1 element center only (useful for fine meshes)
2 element nodes only
3 Lobatto integration with nodes and element centers (Default)
4 Gauss-Legendre integration, gauss integration points only
5 Gauss-Legendre integration and element centers
Thin walled sections are always calculated with a FEM-type method. For solid sections the
more advanced algorithms may create high stress values at singularities. To disable these

SCUT controls the generation of the two standard cuts parallel to the coordinate axis and the
standard stress points for solid cross-sections:
+0 do not generate default shear cuts
+1 create main shear cut (horizontal cut for Vz) at elastic center in concrete cross-
sections
+2 create both default shear cuts (horizontal cut for Vz, vertical cut for Vy) at elastic
center in concrete cross-sections

3.5 Materials
SOFiSTiK supports a large number of different material descriptions. All will be addressed by
a unique material number and should in general be usable everywhere. The default for the
material type and any national deviant parameters is established dependent on the selected
design code NORM. In some cases parameters may be also changed by the selection of a
country code. All values may be modified explicitly if required.
The basic properties are entered via the records:
NORM Selection of a design code or a design code family
MATE General material definition including strength
CONC Concrete material
STEE Steel and other metallic materials
TIMB Timber/lumber and Fibre materials
MASO Masonry / Brickwork
FLAY Layered composite material for QUAD elements
For any material CONC, STEE, TIMB and MASO a unique literal for the material subtype and
a class value are required. The class is always a string with integer numbers and/or optional
characters. In general these two values define all material properties (Some require also a
density or a thickness) It is then possible to change any value individually, although there are
a few implicit dependencies.
These records are mutually exclusive but may be enhanced by other records:
BMAT Elastic support
NMAT Non-linear material properties for MAT/MATE (ASE/TALPA for QUAD and BRIC
elements)
HMAT Material definitions for HYDRA (Thermal or Seepage problems)
SSLA Uniaxial strain-stress law for materials CONC/STEE/TIMB/MASO
MEXT Special material properties
Input of material is possible in all parts of the program system. However, it is self-evident that
not all parameters are used for all types of analysis or system. Each material has a standard
name given by its classification, which might be extended by the user. If the user wants to
replace the standard completely, he has to start his own text with an exclamation mark (e.g.
’!my own Text’) or to quote it a second time (eg. " ’my own Text’ ").
Properties of materials must be distinguished according to whether they are properties which
are close to the realistic behaviour (e.g. for dynamic calculations) or to which have some
lower or upper limit to be multiplied with a safety factor for the calculation of an ultimate load-
SOFiSTiK2023 3-13AQUA|InputDescription
bearing capacity. Whereas the safety factors were formerly assigned more-or-less at random,
sometimes to the load and sometimes to the material, more recent regulations (Eurocode)
provide a clearer separation between safety factors for the loads and factors for the material.
However, since the material safety factors still depend on the nature of the load or the type of
design, it will not be possible to define all safety factors with the material itself.
SOFiSTiK provides therefore the definition of:
• Properties and safety factors for the standard design
• Mean values or calculation values and safety factors for nonlinear serviceability and defor-
mation analysis
If some design codes (DIN 18800, DIN 1045-1) apply additional safety-factors to the mean
values, this may be defined with the stress-strain relation via SSLA. The safety factor defined
with the material will thus be used only for the full plastic forces in AQUA.
Note: The following pages are valid in all details only for AQUA, for other programs
(SOFiMSHB) deviations are possible due to older versions with missing or changed items.

the elastic constants by other values than the Elasticity modulus, the Shear modulus and the
Poisson ratio. You may transform your values by the following formulas:
E Elastic modulus
Es subgrade modulus (horizontally constrained)
K Bulk modulus
G Shear modulus
μ Poisson’s ratio
E E
K = G = (3.1)
3(1−2μ) 2(1+μ)

(1+μ)(1−2μ)
3 · K · E 3 · K · (1−2μ)
G = G = (3.4)
9 · K−E 2 · (1+μ)
If not specified, missing values will be calculated according to these formulas. It is, however,
possible to define non-consistent constants. If no values are given, E defaults to 30000 MPa
and MUE to 0.0.
Orthotropy may be defined via material and thickness of QUAD elements. (see record QUAD
in SOFiMSHA and manuals to ASE and TALPA).
The material law of a transversal orthotropy according to Lechnitzky has one direction that
has different properties, while the description in the plane perpendicular to this direction re-
mains isotropic. This covers most practical problems like timber and rock. Unfortunately the
designation of the general material constants for timber materials is not compatible with that
convention, so we strongly recommend to use TIMB for the description of timber materials.
The principal values E and μ are related to the isotropic plane, while E90 (MAT still old literal
EY) acts normal to that plane and μ 90 and G90 (attention: input parameter G) describe the
transverse straining behaviour between normal direction and isotropic plane. With z being the
normal direction we have:
σ σ σ

ε  = −μ· −μ 90· (3.5a)

It should be noted, that poisson’s ratios μ 90 and μ 90∗ are no longer limited by an upper bound
of 0.5 (this would hold for the isotropic case). According to the formula given above, their
relation is determined by the ratio of the elasticity moduli; this preserves symmetry of the
stress strain matrix, which is required to fulfill elemental equilibrium.
The order of the indices of stress and strain components for subsequent equations is defined
as:
[  y z y z yz ] general three-dimensional case
[  y y z ] plane stain condition, axial symmetry
[  y y ] plane stress.
With axial symmetry x denotes the axis of rotation while y represents the radial and z the
tangential direction.
Furthermore holds:

A general case of anisotropy does not need to be considered since axial symmetry would be

Skew orthotropy:
Consideration of ’skew’ orthotropy is also possible. In geological terms, the three-dimensional
orientationoftheisotropicplaneisdefinedbymeansofthemeridiananddescentangle. They
describe the deviation of the steepest descent to the north direction and the inclination of the
layers. Mathematically, the angles are equivalent to the first and third of the Eulerian angles.
Thetransformationisdefinedbytworotations,thenorthaxis(N)correspondingtotheelement
y-direction and the G-axis corresponding to the element z-direction. Axes K, N and G form a
right handed Cartesian coordinate system.
The transformation is defined as follows:
1. Rotation of axes K and N by meridian angle OAL about G-axis
2. Subsequent tilting of the rotated system (K’, N’, G’=G) by descent angle OAF about axis
K’.
Apart from 3D continuum elements these transformation rules apply to shells and plates, as
well.

3.11.2 Material Parameters
Non-linear material parameters have to be selected very carefully. Especially for soil and rock
mechanics the values of the site have to be used, at least for the final design. There are
some values available in literature (e.g. EC7, DIN 1055 part 2, EAU), but these values are
hardly usable for a non-linear FEM analysis. If we cite some of the values here, we deny any
responsibilities for the correct selection of values for any current project.
Angle of friction
The angle of friction is zero for most fine grained cohesive soils under undrained conditions.
Friction angles larger than 40 degrees are encountered rarely.
Note: A slope without cohesion world cannot be steeper than the material’s ultimate friction
angle.
Cohesion
The cohesion as well as the friction have to be clearly distinguished for drained and undrained
conditions. For fine grained soils a pore pressure is created for sudden loading which de-
creases the possible friction considerably. As time passes, the water will leave the soil, the
friction increases, but the cohesion will be reduced by a factor up to 10.
Dilatancy
Dilatancy denotes the volumetric plastic deformation behavior of a material sample under
shear. The quantity which is used to describe the dilatancy effects is called the dilatancy
angle ψ:
• ψ<0 plasticdeformationassociatedwithreductionofmaterialvolume(compaction)
• ψ=0 volume-neutral plastic deformation (holds, e.g., for steel)
• ψ>0 plastic deformation associated with volume increase
Forsoilmaterials,theplasticdeformationbehaviordependsonthematerial’seffectivedensity,
whichinturnchangeswiththematerial’sloadingstate-therefore,thedilatancyangleisinfact
not a constant quantity. This coherence is described by the well-established stress dilatancy
theory (Rowe [4]), which links the mobilized dilatancy angle ψ m to the actual shear strain-
ing level, the latter being characterized by the mobilized friction angle φ(cid:48) (cf. section NMAT
m
Hardening Plasticity Soil Model - GRAN).
Insoilmechanicsusualwaytoqualitativelyillustratethedilatancyeffectsofnormally(NC)and
overconsolidated soil (OC) is to idealize the soil with an assembly of spherical particles (Fig.
3.3). In case of a loosely packed soil any shear deformation will result in a denser packing of
the particles, followed by a volume decrease, also know as the contraction (Fig. 3.3a). This
process is characterized by the negative angle of dilatancy ψ. On the other hand, shearing
of the initially densely packed soil is only possible if the volume increases (Fig. 3.3b). This
process is also know as dilatation and it is characterized by the positive dilatancy angle.

The easiest way to understand the mechanical interpretation of the dilatancy angle is to look
at the behavior of the soil under a plane-strain conditions subjected to shear τ y (Fig. 3.4).

The internal friction of a densely packed granular material is composed of a sliding friction
3-48 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
between the grains increased by an additional resistance as a result of the granular interlock-
ing. The effect of the dilatancy on the mechanical behavior of the soil, or more precisely on
the friction angle can be illustrated by the sawtooth model shown in Figur0e 3.5 (Maksimovic´
[5]). It is assumed that the friction angle of the non-compacted soil, when the volume gradient
is zero (constant volume), is a constant value and it describes only the friction resistance of
the grains. This angle is called critical state friction angle and usually denoted as φ(cid:48) . For
c
the densely packed soil as a result of the interlocking between the grains, the sheering does
not develop along a straight horizontal plane s− s, but along the sawtooth planes t − t with
the angle of inclination ψ m, called the mobilized dilatancy angle. The friction angle mobilized
along the imaginary horizontal shear plane s− s, φ(cid:48) , can now be determined as the sum of
m
thefrictionanglealongtheinclinedshearplanes t−t, φ(cid:48) c,andmobilizeddilatancyangle, ψ m,
defining the inclination of t−t planes, i.e.

Figure3.5: Sawtoothmodelfordilatancy
For the triaxial stress state the dilatant soil behavior is more complicated than the one de-
scribed by the sawtooth mechanism but the overall behavior is qualitatively similar. In case of
the triaxial stress state, the relationship between the mobilized dilatancy angle and the plastic
strain rates can be described as follows

plastic shear strain.
Figure 3.6a schematically shows the differences in the behavior of the normally consolidated
(NC) and heavily overconsolidated (OC) soils in drained triaxial experiment. As aforemen-
tioned, under shear normally consolidated soils exhibit contractive behavior, while the over-
consolidated soils have a tendency to expand (dilatation) after some small initial range of con-

traction. For NC soils deviatoric stress - axial strain curve will monotonically grow until the
shear strength q cs is reached. On the other hand, OC soils reach their peek shear strength
q pek at a maximal dilatation (maximal inclination of the ϵ −ε  curve), followed by the reduc-
tion of the shear stiffness up to the remaining level q cs corresponding to the zero volumetric
strain gradient. This state is also know as the critical state.

behavior (a.k.a. phase transformation). Above this level of straining, the behavior of the soil
is purely dilatant. The value of φ(cid:48) is in between the critical state friction angle φ(cid:48) and the
ƒ cs
grain-to-grain friction angle φ(cid:48). The friction angle range [φ(cid:48),φ(cid:48) ] is not larger than a couple
μ μ cs
of degrees (Wehnert [6]). For dense soils, the value of the φ(cid:48) will be closer to the φ(cid:48). For
ƒ μ
φ(cid:48)
loose soils as well as for the case of the plain-strain conditions the value of will be closer

to the upper limit, i.e. to the value φ(cid:48) . Peak friction angle φ(cid:48) corresponds to the maximal

dilatancy, i.e. ψ pek.
Evidently the dilatancy is not a constant value - it depends on the stress level. Most advanced
soilmodelsrecognizethisfactbyincorporatingmodelswhichcantakeintoconsiderationstress

If the dilatancy has considerable effects (e.g. due to arch action) the predominant loading
situation should be assessed carefully. As a coarse rule of thumb, for dense soils a value of
+φ/2,formiddledensesoilsavalueof0.0andforloosesoilsavalueof−φ/2canbeadopted.
In contrast, the advanced theoretical setting of the Hardening Plasticity Soil model directly
incorporates a loading state dependent variation of the dilatancy angle according to the above
mentioned stress dilatancy theory (cf. subsection 3.11.7).
Uniaxial Tensile Strength
As tensile stresses are not allowed in soils in general, a tension cut off will be applied for most
soils. However, it might be advisable to define a small uniaxial tensile strength for numerical
reasons. e.g. if the soils becomes stress free at the surface.
3.11.3 Non-linear State Variables (hardening parameters)
General non-linear material laws are normally influenced by the loading history. Therefore,
for every load step material point state-variables are stored to the data base, that can be
visualized with WinGRAF during post-processing. Subsequently, the meaning of the stored
values is shortly explained.

Calibration based on uniaxial and biaxial strength
For subsequent derivations we use a slightly modified variant of yield condition eq. 3.34a,
adopting the hydrostatic stress p (eq. 3.17a) and the deviatoric stress q (eq. 3.17b). Addition-

The hardening rule is based on the hyperbolic stress-strain relationship proposed by Kondner
and Zelasko [13], which was derived from triaxial testing. Hardening is limited by the mate-
rial’s strength, represented by the classic MOHR/COULOMB failure criterion. Additionally, the
model accounts for the stress dependent stiffness according to equations (4-6). A further es-

Stress dependent stiffness
Granular materials show a stiffness behaviour that is dependent on the stress state (and the
compactness of the packing). Extending the approach from (Ohde 1939, 1951) - which was
derived from oedometric testing - by cohesive terms the oedometric modulus’ magnitude de-
pends on the effective axial stress state according to:

1970), which is then used in the model equations (1) to (3).

Plastic volumetric strain (triaxial stress states)
Like other plasticity models, the Hardening Plasticity Soil model incorporates a relationship
between activated plastic shear strains ϵ p and corresponding plastic volumetric strains ϵ p, .
The according flow rule in rate form reads
ϵ˙ p, =ϵ˙ p·sinψ m (3.50)
For the Hardening Plasticity Soil model, the so-called mobilized dilatancy angle ψ m is defined
SOFiSTiK2023 3-61AQUA|InputDescription
from the well-established stress dilatancy theory (Rowe [4]) as (Fig. 3.12)
sinφ −sinφ
m cs
sinψ m = , (3.51)
1−sinφ sinφ
m cs
seealsosubsubsection3.11.2. Therein,thecriticalstatefrictionangleφ cs marksthetransition
between contractive (small stress ratios with φ m <φ cs ) and dilatant (higher stress ratios with
φ m >φ cs ) plastic flow. The mobilized friction angle φ m in Eq. 3.51 is computed according to
σ(cid:48) −σ(cid:48)
sinφ m = 2c·cot1 φ−σ3 (cid:48) −σ(cid:48) (3.52)
1 3
At failure, when φ m ≡φ , also the dilatancy angle reaches its final value ψ m ≡ψ . Accordingly,
from Eq. 3.51 the critical state friction angle can be derived as
sinφ−sinψ
sinφ cs = (3.53)
1−sinφsinψ
SOFiSTiK performs the computation of the critical state friction angle φ cs automatically on
basis of the user specification for the final angles φ and ψ .
It has been recognized that in some cases the Rowe’s model for dilatancy angles (Eq. 3.51)
canoverestimatethecontractivebehaviorofthesoilatlowmobilizedfrictionangles,φ m <φ cs.
As a remedy, several researchers have developed modified formulations based on the original
Rowe’s model. Some of these models which are implemented in SOFiSTiK are described
below.
One of the models which do not require additional input parameters is the model according to
Søreide [15] which modifies the Rowe’s formulation by using the scaling factor sinφ m/sinφ
(Fig. 3.12)
sinφ −sinφ sinφ
m cs m
sinψ m = · . (3.54)
1−sinφ sinφ sinφ
m cs
This method is activated with the TALPA/ASE commands TALPA: CTRL MSTE EMAX 2 and
ASE: CTRL MSTE W4 2.
Wehnert [6] proposed a model based on a lower cut-off value ψ 0 for the modification of the
Rowe’s formulation from Eq. 3.51 at low mobilized friction angles (Fig. 3.12)

 sinψ 0 ; 0<ψ m ≤ψR moe
sinψ m = sinφ m−sinφ cs . (3.55)
 1−sinφ sinφ ; ψR moe <ψ m ≤ψ
m cs
This dilatancy model obviously requires a specification of an additional parameter ψ 0. TALPA
/ ASE commands TALPA: CTRL MSTE EMAX 1 EMIN ψ 0 or ASE: CTRL MSTE W4 1 W5 ψ 0
will deactivate the original Rowe’s model and activate the model acc. to Wehnert [6].
Consideration of a constant dilatancy angle ψ m ≡ ψ , i.e. the deactivation of relationship from
Eq. 3.51, can optionally be requested by specifying TALPA: CTRL MSTE EMAX 0 or ASE:
CTRL MSTE W4 0 in the corresponding TALPA / ASE run (Fig. 3.12).

Special comments
The model can easily be calibrated according to triaxial/oedometric test data. Therefore, de-
formation behaviour of the material prior to failure can be captured with a good accuracy. This
feature, combined with the consideration of specific stiffnesses for primary and un-/reloading,
respectively, constitutes a significant progress when compared to the behaviour of classic
elasto-plastic soil material models. Consequently, GRAN is particularly suited for tasks that
require more precise settlement predictions.

Special comments
Swelling of soils is a complex phemomena that is influenced by various factors. There are two
swelling mechanisms of practical importance that can be distinguished - for both processes
the presence of (pore-) water is a common prerequisite. The first mechanism is termed as the
”osmoticswelling”ofclayminerals,whichbasicallyisinitiatedbyunloadingofclayeysedimen-
tary rock. The second mechanism takes place in sulphate-laden rock with anhydride content.
Inthiscasetheswellingeffectsareduetothechemicaltransformationofanhydridetogypsum-
which goes along with a large increase in volume (61%).
For both described mechanisms a principal dependency between the increase in volume,
caused by swelling, and the state of stress was observed both in laboratory and in in-situ
experiments. The formula employed represents a generalization of the 1-dimensional stress-
strain relationship that HUDER and AMBERG derived from oedometer tests for the final state.
Here the time dependent evolution of the swelling process is not considered.
Theequilibriumstressstatewithrespecttoswellingσ 0 isdefinedbymeansoftheGRPrecord.
For this we use the option PLQ in order to reference a (previously calculated) load case as
”primary state for swelling”. This state is regarded as an equilibrium state with respect to
swelling(normallyin-situsoilpriortoconstructionwork). I.e. swellingstrainincrementscaused
by an eventual ”unloading” from the historical equilibrium state σ 0,hst to this new ”primary

Theconstitutiveequationreproducedaboveislimitedtothefinal(stationary)state,i.e. itrelates
theevolvedswellingstrainstothestressstatethatispresentattimet=∞. Toaccountfortime
dependent behaviour, the relation is extended to the time scale by a formal viscous approach.
Correspondingly, the rate of swelling strains is defined as
ϵq (σ)−ϵq
ϵ˙q = ∞ (3.59)
η
with the retardation time η as a viscosity parameter and ϵq denoting the swelling strains that
havedevelopedattheconsideredtimet. Inrheologicaltermsthisapproachcanbeinterpreted
as a parallel coupling of a ’swelling’ and a dashpot device.
The time dependent response can be calibrated via the retardation time η (P4) - the greater
η the more accentuated is the retardation in the evolution of swelling strains. For η=0 the
response is instantaneous, identical with the non-viscous (instationary) case. Furthermore,
for t→∞ the model’s response converges to the instationary solution - independent of the
adjusted retardation time η . This property enables application of the viscous model also for
stabilisation of the solution process, even if one is not explicitly interested in modelling time
effects.
The SWEL record is specified in addition to a linear elastic or elastoplastic basic material.
Anisotropy is not possible with this model.

This material law may be specified up to three times in addition to the material law of the base
material (elastic, MOHR, DRUC). This allows for the consideration of different distinct fault

where  denotes the crack opening. In this context, the tensile fracture energy G ƒ represents
an objective material parameter. In order to minimize discretization dependent spurious side

In case of P9=0 a tension cut-off with respect to ƒ t,s without consideration of softening is

Undrained Soil
Soil is a porous material consisting of solid particles which together represent the grain skele-
ton. The pores can be filled with fluid (commonly water) and air. Hence we talk about soil as a
three phase system (Figure 3.14).

occupies the pore space (V n =V ) and we speak of soil fully1 saturated with water.
For the following, unless stated otherwise, we restrict ourselves to the soils saturated with
water.
Let us consider an element of soil saturated with water subjected to some external total force
P acting on a plane with area A (Figure 3.15). These external forces are transmitted by a
pore water pressure p  and by stresses in the particles. The stresses in the particles are
a result of the the concentrated forces acting on the contact points between the grains and
the pressure in water encompassing the grains (Figure 3.15a). Assuming that the particle
stiffness is much higher than the stiffness of the soil skeleton as a whole, it follows that the
soil element can deform only by sliding and rolling in the contact points between the particles.
Hence the deformation of the soil skeleton depends solely on the concentrated forces acting

Havingaforementionedinmind,insidethesoilelementwecanconstructasurface s−s which
crosses trough the points of contact between the soil particles (Figure 3.15a). Due to the
relatively small size of soil particles, the s−s surface does not differ much from the plane and
hence it has an area A s which is approximately equal to A. The contact forces acting on s−s
canberesolvedintotangentialandnormalcomponentN ,actinginthedirectionoftheforceP.
Assuming that the contact areas between the soil particles are practically points (their area is
negligible compared to A), the pressure in the water p  will also act on the surface s−s over
the entire area A s ≈A. We can now write the equilibrium equations for the surface s−s in the
vertical direction (Figure 3.15b) as follows:
P=(cid:88) N(cid:48) +p ·A . (3.66)


Dividing Eq. 3.66 with A and introducing the notation σ =P/A and σ(cid:48) =(cid:80)N(cid:48)/A we get:


σ =σ(cid:48)+p  . (3.67)
Eq. 3.67 represents the basis for one of the fundamental principles of soil mechanics pos-
tulated by Karl Terzaghi - the principle of effective stress. This principle states that the total
normal stress σ comprises of effective normal stress σ(cid:48) and pore water pressure p . The
effectivenormalstressσ(cid:48) isameasureofcontactforcesofgranularmaterialandhence,under
the assumptions stated above, it governs the deformation of soils.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-71AQUA|InputDescription
Hint
The Therzaghi’s effective stress principle is based on three main assumptions:
1. Soil is saturated with water
2. Soil particles are very stiff compared to the soil as a whole
3. Contact areas between the soil particles are very small
For standard saturated soil these assumptions are valid; however for rock some of these
assumptions may not hold. In this case the compressibility of rock must be taken into
account and therefore Eq. 3.67 should be modified to take this fact into an account.
The Terzaghi’s principle generalized for a three-dimensional body reads: the total normal
stresses in a saturated soil consist of two parts: effective normal stresses and pore (water
or fluid) pressures (Terzaghi [23]). The effective shear stresses are equal to the total shear
stressessincetheresistanceofporewater(fluid)toshearisneglegible. Thiscanbedescribed
by the following equations:
σ  =σ (cid:48)+p  , ={,y,z} (3.68a)
τ jk =τ j(cid:48) k , j,k ={,y,z} , j(cid:54)=k (3.68b)
where:
σ, τ total normal and shear stresses,
σ(cid:48), τ(cid:48) effective normal and shear stresses,
p  pore (water) stress (negative for pressure).
Writing the Eqs. 3.68 in matrix form, the total stress increments can be expressed as
Δσ =Δσ(cid:48)+Δσ  , (3.69)
where:
Δσ(cid:48) =(cid:104) Δσ(cid:48) Δσ(cid:48) Δσ(cid:48) Δτ Δτ Δτ (cid:105)T , (3.70a)

where D(cid:48) denotes the elasticity matrix of the soil skeleton, as described in MATE.

In the undrained conditions the relative movement between the water (fluid) and soil skeleton
is negligible and therefore the strains are the same for each phase of the soil. Hence, for the
water stress increments we can write:
Δσ  =D ·Δϵ , (3.74)
with D  representing the pore water stiffness matrix which is given by:

K e is a constant and represents the equivalent bulk modulus of the pore fluid (water). Sub-
stituting Eq. 3.75 into Eq. 3.74, and having in mind Eqs. 3.70b and 3.76, we can write the
relationship between the rate of excess pore water pressure Δp e and the rate of volumetric
strain Δϵ 
Δp e =K e·(cid:0)Δϵ +Δϵ y+Δϵ z(cid:1)=K e·Δϵ  . (3.76)
The modulus K e is related to the bulk modulus of the pore water K . This relationship is
examined next.
In an elementary volume V of saturated soil under undrained conditions the pore water occu-
pies a volume V  =n·V and the solid soil particles occupy avolume V s =(1−n)·V, where n
is the porosity (Figure 3.14) . The total volume change in the soil ΔV is equal to the change of
volume in the soil particles ΔV s plus the change of volume in the pore water ΔV , i.e.
ΔV =ΔV s+ΔV  . (3.77)
Sincethesoilparticlesareassumedtobeincompressible(ΔV ≈0),thechangeofthevolume

V cantakeplaceonlyontheaccountofthechangeofporosity. Sincethesoilissaturatedwith
water and under undrained conditions, the change of porosity is only possible if the water in
the pores changes its volume. Taking this into an account and dividing Eq. 3.77 with V, the
total volume change per unit volume of soil Δϵ  reduces to:
ΔV ΔV

Δϵ  ≈ = ·n . (3.78)

The change of volume in the pore water per unit area of pore water, ΔV /V , is directly pro-
portional to the change of pore water pressure Δp e and inversely proportional to the bulk

Comparing Eqs. 3.76 and 3.79 the relationship between the equivalent bulk modulus of the

Writing the effective stress principle given by the Eq. 3.69 in terms of the isotropic stress

K K

n n
where K(cid:48) = Δp(cid:48)/Δϵ  is the bulk modulus of soil skeleton, while K  = Δp/Δϵ  represents the
undrained total bulk modulus of soil.
The equivalent pore water bulk stiffness K /n can be defined by the bulk modulus of the
soil skeleton K(cid:48) and the Skempton’s B-parameter, which is convenient since the Skempton’s
B-parameter can be measured experimentally in the undrained triaxial test. It is for this rea-
son that the Skempton’s B-parameter is chosen as an input parameter (parameter P1) for the
undrained material properties 2.
In the undrained triaxial compression test where the soil sample is subjected to the isotropic
compression (Δσ 1 = Δσ 2 = Δσ 3), Skempton’s B-parameter represents the relationship be-
tween the change of pore pressure Δp  and the change of isotropic total stress Δp =
(Δσ 1+Δσ 2+Δσ 3)/3, i.e.
Δp  =Δp e =B·Δp . (3.82)

Theoretically, for soils fully saturated with water, K  is equal to the bulk modulus of pure water
K0. In many applications the water is assumed to be an incompressible fluid (K0 =∞), which
 
would then imply that the saturated soil is also incompressible (K  = ∞). This corresponds to
the value B = 1, which also marks the upper limit for the Skempton’s B-parameter. This limit

However, fully incompressible behavior of the water is not realistic - water has a very large but
finite bulk modulus K 0 = 2·106 kN/m2, and hence the bulk stiffness of the pore water K /n
is always finite, even if the soil is fully saturated. It follows that Skempton’s B-parameter in real
applications is always smaller than one.
Hint
Moreover, full saturation is also not feasible in reality. Practically, it is not possible to
squeeze out the pore air volume V  completely. Since the ’stiffness’ of air is considerably
smaller than the bulk stiffness of pure water K0, even a very small fraction of remaining

K /n 500

≤500 ⇒ B≤ ≈0.998 . (3.85)
K(cid:48) 501
On the other hand, in order to have the realistic computational results (B ≈ 1), the pore water
stiffness K /n must be substantially larger than the stiffness of the soil skeleton K(cid:48). Therefore
the lower limits are set to
K /n 10

≥10 ⇒ B≥ ≈0.909 . (3.86)
K(cid:48) 11
Default values for bulk stiffness of pore water and Skempton’s B-parameter are
K /n 45

=45 ⇒ B= ≈0.978 . (3.87)
K(cid:48) 46
Very often, the stiffness of the pore water K /n is expressed in terms of the undrained Pois-
son’s ratio ν , the bulk modulus of the soil skeleton K(cid:48) and the effective Poisson’s ratio ν(cid:48):

Special comments
Duetotheirnon-physicalnature,calibrationoftheLADEmodelparametersmaynotbeobvious
atfirstsight. Forthisreason,thebasicprocedureforamaterialwithknownuniaxialtensileand
compressive strength (e.g. concrete) is described in the following. Of particular interest is
the section of the three-dimensional yield surface with one of the principal planes (-> ”Kupfer
3-76 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
Curve”).
Parameter m (exponent) affects the curvature (convexity) of the yield surface towards the hy-
drostatic axis - the larger m the stronger the curvature. In this manner m determines the
shape of the intersection curve. For most types of concrete a value of m between 1.0 and 2.0
is reasonable.
Using the known quantities of uniaxial tensile and compressive strength and the chosen pa-
rameter m, parameter η 1 can now be determined from the condition: For the stress state
corresponding to the uniaxial compressive stress limit the yield condition must be fulfilled.
We rewrite the yield function as:

BMAT defines for an existing material (e.g. MATE/CONC/BRIC) properties for elastic support.
For a QUAD element it is thus possible to select the properties of the plate and the soil by a
single material number. The support stiffness may be calculated from the elasticity constants
ofMREF,ageometricdimensionHandaspecificgeometryrule. Thebeddingapproachworks
according to the subgrade modulus theory (Winkler, Zimmermann/Pasternak). It facilitates the
definition of elastic supports by an engineering trick which, among others, ignores the shear
deformations of the supporting medium. The bedding effect may be attached to beam or plate
elements,butingeneralitwillbeusedasanownelement. (seeSPRI,BOUN,BEAMorQUAD
and the more general description of BORE profiles)
The determination of a reasonable value for the foundation modulus often presents consider-
SOFiSTiK2023 3-81AQUA|InputDescription
able difficulty, since this value depends not only on the material parameters but also on the
geometry and the loading. One must always keep this dependance in mind, when assessing
the accuracy of the results of an analysis using this theory.
The subgrade parameters C and CT will be used for bedding of QUAD elements or for the de-
scriptionofsupportorinterfaceconditions. AQUADelementofaslabfoundationwillthushave
a concrete material and via BMAT the soil properties attached to the same material number.

If subgrade parameters are assigned to the material of a geometric edge (GLN), spring ele-
ments will be generated along that edge based on the width and the distance of the support
nodes.

Non-linear effects are controlled by CRAC, YIEL, MUE and COH:
Cracking: Upon reaching the failure stress, the interface fails in both the axial
and the lateral direction. The failure load is always a tensile stress.
If the bedding reaction is applied to a QUAD element, a deformation
in the direction of the local z-axis will create compressive (negative)
stresses.
Yield load: Upon reaching the yield stress, the principal deformation component
of the interface increases without an increase of the stress.
Friction/cohesion: Defining a friction and/or a cohesion coefficient, the lateral shear
stress can not become larger than:
Friction coefficient * normal stress + Cohesion
Please note, that before reaching this limit the stiff-ness CT will pro-
duce the shear stress only if a deformation is present.
If the principal interface has failed (CRAC), then the lateral bedding acts only if 0.0 has been
entered for both friction- coefficient and cohesion.
The non-linear effects can only be taken into account by a non-linear analysis. The friction is
an effect of the lateral bedding, while all other effects act upon the principal direction.
3.12.2 Rigid Frictional Interface
The Rigid Frictional Interface describes the mechanical behavior of a thin interface layer inbe-
tween two bodies with frictional contasct by adopting a friction law of Coulomb type. For the
interface layer a quasi-rigid behavior is assumed.
A typical field of application is the modeling of soil-structure interaction in geotechnical analy-
ses. The Rigid Frictional Interface Element (I2D) is available in the FEA module TALPA.
Hint
For the Rigid Frictional Interface Element (I2D), an explicit provision of stiffness parame-
ters is normally not required; instead, the program establishes appropriate stiffness val-
ues automatically in a mesh adaptive manner. Explicit provision of stiffness parameters
overrides this mechanism, the provided values are adopted unmodified.
Interface strength is determined from the reference material by means of the strength
reduction factor:
MUE=RFAC·tnφ reƒ (3.106a)
COH=RFAC·c reƒ (3.106b)
RSS=ƒ t,reƒ (3.106c)
Alternatively, a direct input of strength parameters is supported, too.

HMAT allows to specify three individual sets of constants for three tasks diffusion, seepage
and heat flow for a material. Material properties have to be selected according to literature or
experimental data. But some rough estimates (without warranty) are given here.
For any material there might be up to 15 different sets of materials for different temperatures
[ ◦ Celsius] or pore water pressures [ kPa = kN/m2] . With a nonlinear analysis the material
values will then be interpolated between those values.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-85AQUA|InputDescription
Large jumps (e.g. by more than 10 times) of the material values K and S in adjacent regions
can lead to numerical problems in a non-linear calculation, i.e. to a poor iteration process.
These problems can be solved by material transition regions, smaller and more iteration steps
and/or a coarser iteration tolerance.
3.13.1 Hydraulic Parameters
For seepage (DARC,FORC,MISS) the unit for conductivity (KXX, KYY, KZZ) is [m/sec], for
storage coefficient (S) [m3/m]. TEMP is the pressure in [kPa].
e.g. Hydraulic permeability (acc. Dyck, Peschke):
Type of soil k [ m/sec]
Sandy gravel 3·10−3 ... 5·10−4
Gravelly sand 1·10−3 ... 2·10−4

Silty sand 2·10−4 ... 1·10−5
Sandy silt 5·10−5 ... 1·10−6
Silty clay 5·10−6 ... 1·10−8
Clay ≈ 10−8
Positivepressuresrepresentsaturatedflowregionswhilenegativevaluesdescribeunsaturated
soils. Conductivities and Capacities will be interpolated. Free surface problems also use a
variation of the porosity to account for the effective capacity of the free surface.
Material values may be defined isotropic or anisotropic depending on a stress state from the
database. This is performed by additional data given with the same material number and the
types FVOL, FSIN or FSIT. The difference between FSIN and FSIT is given by the fact that
FSIN modifies the values across the crack, while FSIT does this perpendicular to the crack. It
is recommended to use a linear stress field for that purpose and not a plasticity field.

via a given material number (engineering constructions) or via the nodes (element material
number = 0), especially for ground water models. Both methods may be used together within
the same system.
For a general diffusion according to potential theory, the unit for conductivity (KXX, KYY, KZZ)
is [sec/m], for storage coefficient (S) [kg/m3/Pa]=[sec2/m].
3.13.2 Heat Conduction
Heat conduction according to the equations of Forier (FOUR). The unit for conductivity (KXX,
KYY, KZZ) is [W/K/m], for storage coefficient (S) specific capacity*Density [J/Km3]. TEMP is
the temperature in degree Celsius or Kelvin, which may be selected with an explicit unit in the
table headder.

3.14.1 Eurocode / DIN 1045-1 / OEN B 4700
According to Eurocode EN 1992 and other design codes derived from that the following types
are available:
C = regular concrete
LC = light-weight concrete
As the German DIN Fachbericht anticipates the design rules of the upcoming Eurocode, but
references cite explicitly the old DIN 1045-1, it is recommended to specify the correct material
type with C_EN or CDIN unambiguously.
The cylindrical strength is always to be input for FCN. The default value is 20.
Some properties are dependent on so called boxed values or other national regulations. The
definitionofNORMisusedtoselectthosevariants. Thepossiblevaluesforexamplearegiven
in table 3.1 and 3.2 of EN, resp. table 9 and 10 of DIN 1045-1 resp. table 4 of OEN B 4700
and not repeated here in detail.

FCN 55 60 70 80 90 100
ƒ ck,cbe 67 75 85 95 105 115
The default values for strength and elastic modulus are derived as follows:
FC = 0.85 · ƒ ck
2/3
FCT = 0.3 · ƒ ck (ƒ ck <55)
= 2.12n((ƒ ck+ (ƒ ck >55)
8)/10+1)
EC = 9500(ƒ ck+8)0.3 (EN 1992-1992)
EC = 22000(ƒ cm/10)0.3 (EN 1992-2004)
FBD = 2.25 · ƒ ct,0.05/γ (Tbl. 5.3.)
The coefficients α cc and α c for the long term strength effects are defined in the national an-
nexes. The Eurocode suggests values between 0.8 and 1.0 and recommends as default the
value of 1.0. However SOFiSTiK uses a default on the safe side of 0.85, if not specified ex-
plicitly in the INI-file according to the national annex. An explicit definition of FC = α cc·FCN
is possible of cause. However, for the fatigue, bond or tensile strength values all corrective
factors and the safety should be included in the input data.
For the elasticity modules we have to distinguish between a secant modulus Ecm (Input value
ECofthisrecord)forelasticdeformations,especiallyconstrainingforcesandatangentialmod-
ulusEc0,28 =1.05Ecm orEc0,28 =Ecm / α  ,usedforcreepandnonlinearanalysis(inputitem

The value ECR may be also defined with an explicit unit [-] as factor to the default value, as
recommended in Heft 600 of DAfStB with 0.85 for non lnear analysis.
For light-weight concrete (LC) according to density RHO has to be defined explicitly in kg/m3.
GAM and EC will then be defined appropriately.

In case of a fire design it is required to distinguish between quartzitic and calcareous aggre-
gates. For the second case an additonal character C may be appended to the cement type:
NC, SC and RC.

SOFiSTiK2023 3-93AQUA|InputDescription
The safety factors SCM are preset to 1.5 (in Italy to 1.6). However, they should be selected at
the design explicitly, because they are dependent on the loading combinations. For concrete
with high strength the factor will be increased by γ’, which will be incorporated in the strain-
stress laws immediately, to allow a global safety factor to be used for the design.
For non-linear analysis with a unified safety factor according to DIN 1045-1 the strength of the
concretewillbereducedtoavalueof0.85αfck,whilethoseofthereinforcementswillberaised.
These non linear analysis stress-strain laws are generated automatically for DIN 1045-1. For
DIN EN1992 these alternate curves have to be selected with SSLA CALC 1.3 for CONC and
STEE explicitly.
For steel fibre concrete according to DAfStb-Richtlinie (Juni 2021) it is allowed to use higher
concrete tensile bending strength values for elements with concretes up to C50/60. If desired
the user has to enter that value of FCTD explicitly. Values are defined as follows:

With these values the stress strain laws according to pictures R.1 or R.2. of the DAfStb paper
are created.
The increased saftey factor according 2.4.2.5 EN 1992 (2004) for cast in place piles with kf =
1.1 has to be specified by the user explicitly.
3.14.2 DIN 1045 old / DIN 4227 / DIN 18806:
The old DIN can be addressed with:
B = regular concrete (DIN)
LB = light-weight concrete (DIN)
SB = pre-stressed concrete (DIN)
The default FCN is 25 for B and LB, and 45 for SB. FCT is defined by:

DIN 4227 has some contradictions about the bond stress. Chapter 13 gives values which
correspond quite well to the ratios given in table 7 of appendix A1. But these values do not
match those given at DIN 1045 Table 19. Thus we have decided to enlarge the FBD values
for concrete SB by a factor of 1.43. With that amendment the value may be used for the bond
design according to chapt. 13 of DIN 4227.
For standard concrete a parabola-rectangular stress-strain diagram will be selected. SCM will
default to 1.00. If you analyse composite sections you might want to change the value. High
strength concrete will have lesser ultimate strains.
3.14.3 OENORM B 4700 / B 4750
Although the OENORM B 4700 calls itself close to Eurocode, it deviates just with the clas-
sification of concrete based on the cubic strength instead of the cylindrical strength. As the
designation is C resp. LC the user has to select the option NORM OEN.
B = regular concrete based on cube strength (Ã–NORM 4700)
LB = light-weight concrete on cube strength (Ã–NORM 4700)
SOFiSTiK2023 3-95AQUA|InputDescription
C = regular concrete on cylindrical strength (Ã–NORM 4700)

SCM is preset to 1.5, FCTK to 0.7 · FCT.
3.14.4 Swiss Standard SIA
The SIA 262 (2003) is very similar to the Eurocodes, but there are numerous deviations (E-
Modulus, bond strength, stress-strain law). As type we have therefore:
C = cylindrical strength of regular concrete (SIA 262)
LC = cylindrical strength of light-weight concrete (SIA 262)
The design strength is calculated according section 4.2.1.2 and 4.2.1.3 with two factors η ƒc
and η t. The first factor is applied for the definition of FCN automatically. As the second factor
is depending on the design situation it can be modified similar to the Eurocode with a boxed
value ALF-CC beforehand or later.
The elastic moduli are calculated based on the mean strength. For light-weight concrete the
values are corrected depending on the specific weight. The default stress-strain diagram is
always according to the deformation stress strain law of EC-2, even for the design. SCM will
be preset with 1.5.

GF is taken as w0.3/lc.
3.14.6 Spanish EHE
The Spanish EHE (Instruccin de hormign estructural) is very similar to the Eurocode. Devia-

3.14.7 Swedish BBK
The Swedish BBK has rather complex provisions for the safety factors, which are influenced
by the safety class (see NORM) and are different for the elasticity modulus and the strength.
The new release (2004) uses now the designations according to the EC, but keeps the safety
concept of the old BBK. Then we have:
C = 16, 20, 25, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 54, 55, 58, 60
LC = 8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60
As the BBK does not state any details about the transition zone in the work law, the user has
the possibility to influence with FCR between 0.6FCK and 1.0FCK the shape of this curve.

3.14.12 American concrete institute ACI 318M
As class we have the specified compressive strength fc’ in MPa:

(cid:198) ƒ c(cid:48) . The modulus of rupture fr is the upper fractile value of the tension strength. ACI 9.5.2.3
defines:
ƒ r =0.75 · (cid:113) ƒ c(cid:48) <0.75 · 25/3 (3.120)
or for lightweight concrete:
ƒ =0.70 · mn((cid:113) ƒ (cid:48),1.8 · ƒ )

ƒ =0.70 · 0.75 · (cid:113) ƒ (cid:48)

The ratio of the fractiles is thus 1.26. The mean value fct−m will be preset to 0.5 · (cid:198) ƒ c(cid:48) . All
other values will be derived from this value by a factor. If needed the lower fractile may be
given, which will then set the upper value. But this value is only used for those cases where
explicitly the value fr is used within a formula.
The bond strength will be set to the non-physical maximum value for chapter 12.2 of ACI 318

3.14.16 Indian Standards IS / IRC
With the IRC 112 a complety new design code has been released, which is strongly related to
the Eurocode EN 1992. The nominal strength FCN is now the cylindrical strength. However
there are a lot of deviations in the coefficients, which are not all described here. For example
the mean strength fcm is defined as fck+10 and the tensile strength is about 13% less. More
details may be found in the chapter for the Eurocode.
For the IRC 112 following concretes are availalbe:

This design code has a standard safety of 1.3 for normal and light weight concrete, but also
a table with explicit design strength values R bn. A modification of this design strength for long
term and short design situations should be done at the design in AQB by selecting DESI or
ACCI, but all other factors should be defined either with an explicit value or as a factor e.g.
0.9[−] at FC.

The specifications which are a part of the steel quality and are printed in italics (e.g. T, T8,
4) describe the thicknesses. They have to be input by the user only in the case of a CADINP
input.
The strength values especially for the high strength steels may vary depending on the manu-
facturerandthealloyconsiderably,acheckoftheassumedvaluesagainsttheactualvaluesis
strongly recommended.
The maximum allowed plate thickness may be specified via TMAX, reducing the strength val-
ues according to the design codes. As different strength values within the section may lead to
3-112 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
consistency problems for some design tasks, we allow only for a unified approach based on
themaximumthickness. Itwillbecheckedduringthegenerationofsections. Formanygrades
one may append an identifier for a maximum plate thickness for a direct definition.
Attention: The maximum thickness will be also used to control if the design of a composite
section with DESI in AQB will allow compressive strains beyond the yield limit. For sections of
classes 3 and 4, this limit will be observed by default. For sections of class 1 or 2, the strain
becomes unlimited by definition of TMAX 0.0.
The safety factor SCM0 is the value for the resistance of sections (γ M0 = 1.0 according EN
1993-1-1). It will be preset according to the material and the design code and will be used to
calculatethedesignforcesforsteelandcompositesections. Forthedesignbymemberchecks

For the Russian design steel the defaults are nominal values according to SB 16.13330.2011
any conversions, round off or higher values for rolled steel have to be specified by the user
explicitly.

EC 9 and the new DIN 4113 (2002) use the American system for classification of aluminium
alloys. As there are more than 300 different materials available, with significant differences of
properties, the user should check the thickness limit and strength parameters thoroughly. For
3-114 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
the default values the following scheme has been used:
• For plates we use the type AWP to distinguish them properly from the profile and tubes.
For untreated alloys only the number of the alloy is necessary.
• For tubes and profiles the type AW is used and either ER or DT (drawn tubes) or the
important criteria of the heat treatment as T4, T5, T6 or TX for T66 has to be appended to
the alloy as characters.
• For the castings the case of a cocille and temper F or T6 has been selected as default.
As the reduction of the strength in the HAZ is depending on the welding process and the
thickness, the user has to define a separte Materialnumber for those regions with a explicitly
reduced values for FY and FT.
DIN4113requiresthestressforaluminumtobereducedforcreepeffectsaccordingtochapter
6.3 with a factor c between 0.8 and 1.0. As the exact evaluation would be rather complex, this
is accounted for by the global factor of safety 1/c. The default on the safe side is a value of
1.25. Better values have to be specified explicitly by the user.
A reduction for generally higher temperatures has to be specified explicitly, but the reduction
for the fire case is available via the stress strain law.
The values ES and GAM are for all classes with 70000 [MPa] and 28.0 [kN/m3] preset, the
values FP and EPSY are selected according to the data of table 10 of the DIN 4113.

For the steel type B it is possible to attach to the grade extra characters defining the ductility:
A Reinforcing bars with standard ductility (cold deformed)
B Reinforcing bars with high ductility (warm deformed)
C Reinforcing bars with very high ductility (warm deformed)
For prestressing steel according to EN it is possible to add a A or B at the type in order to
consideration of the class according to EN 1992-1-2 table 3.3.
For the German steel type BST the characters SA/SB resp. MA/MB for bars resp. meshes
allow also to select between new DIN 1045-1 and old DIN 1045.
The safety factor is preset for most reinforcing and prestressing steels to 1.15 and 1.05 (BS)
respectively. The safety factor becomes effective immediately for the calculation of the full
plastic internal forces of steel and composite sections.
Fornon-linearanalysiswithaconstantsafetyfactoraccordingtoDIN1045-1thestrengthofthe

stress-strain law is generated with a safety factor of 1.3.
TheRussianSNIPhasareducedstrengthforshearlinksandinclinedbars. Thisvalueistaken
from the value FP. In the very general case, it might be necessary to use a separate material
with a reduced strength.
Attention:
Some material parameters may depend on other parameters not known to the program. E.g.
the dynamic stress range of the reinforcements is not only depending on the diameter TMAX
of the bars but also on the curvature and the type of the material of the duct (steel, plastic). In
all those cases it is necessary to use different material numbers and to specify the deviating
values explicitly.

3.15.5 Relaxation
Relaxation of tendons is implemented in AQUA/AQB as a product. While the time factor is
specified in AQB, AQUA defines the stress dependant factor for the reference time of 1000 h.

In Germany the values of the general technical approval. The values of a typical approval are
provided as default, but may be redefined with MEXT if required.
3.15.6 Bond Properties
The bond properties are specified highly different within the codes. They depend both on the
concrete and the steel properties. When defining the concrete the maximum bond stress for
optimal bond properties is specified. The value R defines then the relative bond strength for
this steel as specified in:
Tab. 6.2 EN 1992-1-1 ( R = 0.3 ÷ 0.8)
Tab. 15 DIN 1045-1 ( R = 0.3 ÷ 0.8)
Tab. 7 DIN 4227 A1 ( R = 0.3 ÷ 0.9)
§9.3.1 GB 50010 (R = α/0.14 = 0.737 ÷ 1.077)
If different bond properties should be applied, different materials have to be specified. The
bond value is needed for
• Minimum reinforcements
• Crack width
• Fatigue
• Limitation of stress increase for tendons
Therelativebondpropertiesaremainlyintendedinthedesigncodestoaccountforthereduced
values of tendons. But it should also account for different diameters and properties of passive
reinforcements. For the crack width a mean value has to be used where the diameter and the
SOFiSTiK2023 3-125AQUA|InputDescription
bond properties become effective.
Please see also remarks for FBD in record CONC.
The second coefficient is used for those design codes using special values not clearly de-
ductible from the relative bond coefficients alone. This is especially the base version of the
Eurocode, but also the russian SNIP:
§4.14 SNIP 2.03.01 ( K1 := η = 1.0 ÷ 1.4)
§7.2.12 SP 52-101 ( K1 := φ 2 = 0.5 ÷ 0.8)
The defaults are given in principal in the following table. However, there are some deviations
depending on the design code and the strength possible:
R K1
Reinforcing steel 1.0 0.8
Prestressing steel 0.5 1.6
3.15.7 Stress-Strain Relations
The stress-strain law may have up to 4 segments:
• Up to the proportional limit (FP/ES,FP)
• Up to the yield limit (EPSY,FY) EPSY may be defined absolute (positive) or relative to the
strain limit (negative)
• Up to the tensile strength (EPST,FT)
• Constant to the nearly infinity (1000 o/oo)
Depending on the steel type and grade the values EPSY and EPST as well as FP will be
preset. With explicit definitions you may suppress:
• If FP is not lesser than FY the first part will be omitted.
• If EPST is not greater than EPSY the third part will be omitted.
More general stress-strain laws are specified via record SSLA.
In general the stress-strain laws are identical for serviceability and ultimate limit design. How-
ever, for reinforcing steel according to EC2 and DIN 1045-1 there are numerous explicit
changes.
As the safety factor concept will not generate an affine curve for the ultimate state, the safety
factor will be applied immediately.
Although the tensile strength for reinforcement steel with standard ductility will be reached at
25 o/oo, it is not allowed to use this in the design according to DIN 1045-1. The stress strain
laws for design and non linear analysis differ therefore for those materials.

There are many composite materials in timber constructions. Although a precise treating is
possible with composite sections or FLAY, the design codes provide equivalent materials for
that purpose. As the strength is no strongly dependant on the thickness of the construction
part, the definition of that value with TMAX is mandatory.
The description of a transverse orthotropy material law has one direction that has different
properties (fibre direction), while the description in the plane perpendicular to this remains

the fibre direction parallel to the rotational axis x, i.e. the x direction is normal to the plane of

Definition of fibre direction:
Depending on the element type we have slightly different orientations of orthotropy:
For beams the fibre direction is identical with that of the beam axis.
For planar systems (TALPA) the value OAF is the angle between the fibre direction and the
elementx-direction. ThevaluesE90 andμ90thenholdwithintheisotropicplanewhosenormal
is given by the (skew) fibre direction.
For shells and plates it might be possible (eg. plywood) that there are fibres in both x and y
direction. The anisotropy effects thus reduces to different shear moduli for in plane membrane
shear (Gm=0.5E90/(1+μ)) and the transverse shear force directions (G). This may be accom-

Stress-Strain curves define the dependency of the stress from the strains. They are required
for the design and nonlinear analysis. There are three different types to be distinguished:
• SERV Curves for the serviceability based on mean values.
• ULTI Curves for the ultimate resistance based on the design values.
• CALC Curves for a nonlinear analysis.
For a nonlinear analysis it is most reliable and most economical to use the method of double

book keeping (Quast) where the true deformations are evaluated based on the mean values
and the ultimate capacity is evaluated separately with the design values. This is congruent to
the classic approach of a linear analysis and a design as a post processing step. EN 1992-
1 covers this in section 5.8.(3) with the very first sentence or the more detailed hints in the
German NA to this subject. This is controlled in AQB/ASE/STAR2 with an input of:
DESI ULTI KSV ULD ULD ; NSTR SERV KSV SL SL
For stability problems it might be requested to apply a safety factor on the stiffness too. If this
factor is included in the stiffness or at the load is a matter of taste, but the nonlinear nature
of the problem does not allow to use the same factor on either side of the equations. This is
controlled in AQB/ASE/STAR2 with an input of:
DESI ULTI KSV ULD ULD ; NSTR ULTI KSV SLD SLD
While the mean values of the concrete are specified in the design codes, there is no definition
forthereinforcingsteel. Acommonassumptionistoincreasthestrengthbyafactorof1.1. As
this is comparable to the safety factor and a yielding will decrease the stiffness considerably it
is also common practice to use the option SLD SL instead.
However, it might be desirable to perform design and nonlinear analysis within a single run.
Then special curves are needed based on design values of the strength, but a stiffness based
on the mean values with a special saftey factor. This is controlled in AQB with an input of:
NSTR NONL KSV CALD CALD
EN 1992-1 covers this in section 5.8.(3) with the second and third sentence. As the German
NAprovidesanalternateversioninsection5.7withaglobalsystemsafetyof1.3,theuserhas
todecidebetweenthosetwomethodsbythedefinitionofthesafetyfactorfortheCALCcurve.
The default is according to 5.7. It has to be pointed out, that this method does not include any
safety on the stiffness. Thus there are three possibilities to include that:
• Reduction of the ECM according Heft 600 DAfStB with 0.85, to be specified with TVAR
ALF-CE 0.85 SCOP DESI
• Division of the total curves by a factor 1.3, which is not provided here
• Ultimate load analysis with a factor of 1.3 and stress-strain curves without a safety factor
If the default stress-strain curves are not applicable, stress-strain curves must be defined im-
mediately after the input of the material. For special applicationes each set may have multiple
temperature levels, to be defined in ascending order of temperature. A stress-strain curve
starts with one of the possible headers:
SSLA SERV safety_factor [ LIM/EXT] [ TEMP tempval]
SSLA ULTI safety_factor [ LIM/EXT] [ TEMP tempval]
SSLA CALC safety_factor [ LIM/EXT] [ TEMP tempval]
Thesafetyfactorsarepredefinedasspecifiedwiththematerial,butmaybechangedifneeded.
In particular it is possible to modify a standard stress-strain law with an own safety factor, by
defining a header record only. The design codes use the safety factors quite differently, some
SOFiSTiK2023 3-137AQUA|InputDescription
materials will be divided by the safety factor in total, others reduce only the maximum stress
value and keep the elasticity modulus. A positive safety factor will select the first case, while
a negative value will select the second one. For the standard design tasks the material safety
factors are chosen by AQB depending on the loading condition and design code.
For the CALC curves we have a slightly other rule to account for the German NA. A negative
safety factor will activate the curve according to chapter 5.7, while a positive safety factor
will trigger the rule according to chapter 5.8 with a safety factor γ ce for E cm. This factor is
predefined in the INI-file, but may be overwritten as boxed value with a TVAR GAM-CE. A
safety factor of 0.0 will deactivate the calculatoric curves.
The stress-strain curve follows. Each consists of several data points in an ordered sequence.
For each data point it is specified whether it should behave as a vertex (linear polygon line) or
it should be part of a smooth curve (quadratic or cubic parabola).
The user must make sure that a sufficiently large strain range gets covered and that the zero
point constitutes a data point of its own. Strains outside the defined range will have for TYPE
EXT the last defined stress value and will use the tangent at the last point, provided this has a
positive elasticity module. If the TYPE is specified as LIM, stresses outside the defined range
willbecomezero,whichhoweverleadtotroubleinnumericalbehaviourofnon-lineariterations.

explicit data points and without Temperature it is possible to define with EPSS a factor for the
strains. This may be used to account for creep effects as specified in the EN 1992 with 1+ϕ.
It should be noted however, that in this case the creep becomes also effective for variable
actions.

each of these materials with TEMP. One may shift the stress strain curve wih a definition of
EPSS SHIF by the thermal strain allowing to activate all eigenstresses directly without the
need to define a temperature at the section itself in detail.
The contribution of the concrete between the cracks (Tension Stiffening) may be taken into
account by a modification of the stress strain law of the concrete or the steel. With a single
record SSLA SERV a modification of the reinforcement stress strain law for that purpose is
possible. However a solution is only possible if the ratio of reinforcement is large enough to
avoid the complete rupture of the reinforcement, which is equivalent to the requirement that
the initial crack stress in the reinforcement must not exceed the yield limit.
The reinforcement ratio MUET is only determined in advance for an annular section (or those
with a similar evenly distributed reinforcement). For all other cases, the design task should
adopt the stress strain law accordingly.

• General description of soil mechanic strata
• Properties of the constrained soil modulus for the analysis of settlements or a half space
modelling with HASE.
• Soil bedding modulus for the pile elements. These values are derived from the soil mod-
ulus above by a multiplication with a form factor with typical values between 0.5 and 2.0.
More precisely the soil modulus is transferred to a Winkler bedding constant [kN/m3] by a
division with some structural dimension and is then integrated by a multiplication with the
width of the pile section. Please refer to the explanations of the record BBLA for formulas
and examples.
For simple regular cases it is also possible to define design stresses for the soil pressure with
record BTAB. These values are than applicable without reference to the strata data.

aparabolicstiffnessdistribution. Sincethereisnoexplicitstiffnessincrease#dEs1defined,
a continuous distribution is realized - the concluding stiffness value will be equal to the
stiffness value of the subsequently defined BLAY (#Es2).
• Second layer L2 has a linear stiffness distribution. This time, #dEs2 is defined, so the
concluding stiffness value will be #Es2+#dEs2.
• Third layer L3 has a constant stiffness distribution with the value #Es3.
If there is only one BLAY defined, then the ending depth is by default 999m. If the number
of BLAY record is larger than 1, the last BLAY defines the ending depth S while the other
properties of this BLAY are ignored.
Apart from stiffness modulus ES, all other properties of the BLAY record (MNO, MUE, PMAX,
PMAL, C, PHI) are constant within a layer.
Stiffness modulus ES and Poisson’s ration MUE can alternatively be set by reference of a
material number, where corresponding elastic material properties are defined. If within the
same BLAY record MNO and ES and/or MUE are defined, the values defined within BLAY
have precedence over those defined by material MNO. If the Poisson’s ratio MUE is defined
and larger than 0.0, then ES is interpreted as the elastic modulus, and a Boussinesq method
is used in program HASE (see HASE manual for more details).
By default (no input) the non-linear resistance properties (PMAX, PMAL and C) are switched
off, meaning that the x-pile nodal forces are not limited (elastic analysis). As in the default
case, the input of a resistance property smaller or equal zero will result in the x-pile contact
forces to be unlimited. Any input of the resistance properties larger than zero will activate the

non-linearities along the x-pile.
Hint
• As a prerequisite for a meaningful soil-layer interpolation, all defined bore profiles
(BORE) within a grid must have the same number of layers (BLAY).
• For a consistent input of the BLAY-resistance properties it is required that within a
layer of each of the used bore profiles the resistance properties be either defined
or undefined. Otherwise the interpolated properties can have unpredictable values.
In other words, the input where the resistance properties within a layer for some bore
profilesaredefined,whilefortheothersarenotdefined,willmostlikelyyieldundesired

According DIN we have e.g. Deƒƒ = min(D,1.0). For more complex cases where the bedding
stress is not uniform but more like a cosine, there are of course other values possible. There-

Link capacity
For the individual link reactions the upper and lower limits of the capacity can be defined.
These limits can then be referenced by the corresponding work laws (see SFLA) during their
definition.
Hint
Thisdefinitionalonedoesnotcausetheactuallimitationofthecorrespondingpermissible
reaction force. The actual reaction, and with it the possible limitation of the permissible
force, must be defined together with the corresponding work law.
The values for the tension P+ and compression capacity P- play a special role. With the
definition of these capacities it is possible to formulate other reactions R with respect to the
axial load of the link element. The input of the normal force dependent family of work law
curves (see SFLA LEV) for the reaction R describes an interaction between the actual acting
normal force and the reaction R ( P-R interaction). For P≥P+ or P≤P− due to the interaction
the reaction is R ≡ 0.0; for the normal force levels in between, the permissible reaction R is
described by the user specified family of the work laws.
The capacity values are taken into consideration for the IHNG and PMM link types.
ALPH
The interaction exponent α ≥ 1.0 describes the interaction between the My and Mz reactions
according to

For example, with ALPH = 1.0 a linear interpolation between My and Mz is carried out. With
increasingexponent ALPH,thefullnessoftheinteractioncurveincreasesaswell;with ALPH=
2.0 the interaction curve corresponds to an ellipse.
The default value ALPH = 0.0 defines a decoupled behavior of the My and Mz reactions (
mathematically this corresponds to α→∞ in Eq. 3.139)
The interaction exponent ALPH is only active for the PMM link type.

In the example folder ase.dat/english/spring the differences between AQUA-

use the same SMAT work laws, as shown in Figure 3.28. The only difference is that the work
law for PKIN has an increasing end-tangent, see remarks to PKIN in Figure 3.28. Normal
plastic work laws (MTYP PLAS+PISO+HYPE) should have a horizontal end-tangent to clearly
define the final strength (Figure 3.28).
The four material types PLAS, PISO, PKIN and HYPE result in a different response under a

Plastic deformation induced hardening effects an extension of the elastic stress domain. The

ƒ := (3.140)
σ−ƒ y,t(cid:0)ε p,t(cid:1) for σ >0
In the example (Figure 3.28), the initial tensile hardening (1) is followed by an unloading step
to σ = 0 (2). So far, no compressive hardening has been triggered. Therefore, the continued
unloading path follows the initial loading path defined by the compressive branch of the work
law (3).
Isotropic Hardening
In contrast to the anisotropic approach, plastic strains are effective for hardening irrespective
of their direction (compression/ tension). Tensile plastification, e.g., also induces compres-
sive hardening and vice versa.6 Consequently, the yield function adopts the same hardening
variable tensile and compressive behavior:

|σ|−(cid:12) (cid:12)ƒ y,c(cid:0)−κ p(cid:1)(cid:12) (cid:12) for σ ≤0

κ p :=m(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:12)ε p,c(cid:12) (cid:12),ε p,t(cid:1) (3.142)
In the example (Figure 3.28), the initial tensile hardening (1) is followed by an unloading step
to σ =0 (2). For compression, the so far developed hardening strain is also effective, causing
a correpondingly extended elastic domain (4).
PKIN Kinematic Hardening
Formanymaterials,itcanbeobservedthatplasticstrainingintensionalsoinducesareduction
of the compressive yield strength for a subsequent compressive loading (and vice versa). For
steel materials, this effect is known as Bauschinger effect. The kinematic hardening model

aims at describing this effect and defines plastic hardening as a translation of the initial yield
strength ƒ y0 without changing the extension of the initial elastic domain. Mathematically, this
notion is adopted by introducing the so-called back stress q as a function of the plastic defor-
mation ε p. 7
The yield function reads now
ƒ :=(cid:12) (cid:12)σ−q(cid:0)ε p(cid:1)(cid:12) (cid:12)−ƒ y0 (3.143)
The adopted kinematic hardening model is characterized by the following conditions:
• Initial loading follows the the original work law.
• The extension of the initial elastic stress space, defined by the initial yield strength ƒ y0,
remains unchanged.

• The allowable stress space is limited by the final tangents of the defined work law.
• For sufficient plastification in positive or negative direction, the end tangent is reached.
Possibly, a stretching of the nonlinear portion of the work law beyond ƒ y0 is performed,
siehe Figure 3.31.
Subsequently, we describe the response based on the provided work law according to ??.
Important is the first point in the work law (5) that defines the length of the unloading part.
The unloading part from point (1) does not end at σ = 0 but at point (6). From there first the
linear part is attached to reach (5’). Then the nonlinear part of the worklaw (5)-(1) is streched
(5’)-(1’) and added to reach the lower end tangent of the negative part of the worklaw at (1’)
(end tangent = green line in Figure 3.31).
For multiple cyclic loading with increasing load factor PKIN shows the typical kinematic hard-
ening force-displacement curve (see Figure 3.29).
Figure 3.30 shows the kinematic hardening for a curved work law without linear part (fy=0).
The stretching of the nonlinear part of the work law for a curved work law with linear part
(fy=60) is demonstrated in figure 3.31. In a first unloading the new zero point of the work law
is reached (red circle). If at that point the original work law curve would be added, you would
never reach the lower end tangent (two upper pictures). Therefore the nonlinear part of the
work law is streched to reach the lower end tangent (lower picture).

HYPE Hyperelastic
The response is nonlinear elastic, without plastic deformation. Upon load reversal, HYPE
follows the same path as in the loading phase (7) (Figure 3.28).
GAP
Provision of an optional gap is accomplished independent of the work law by defining a corre-
sponding GAP spring property (e.g. via SOFIMSHA: SPRI).
Aprovided gapis symmetricallyeffectiveboth fortensionand compression. The magnitude of
the gap is not affected by possible plastic deformation, it remains constant (cf. Figure 3.32).
For material type MTYP PKIN, gap functionality is not supported.

CRAC
An optional tensile strength can be provided independent of the work law via definition of a
corresponding CRAC spring property (e.g. SOFIMSHA: SPRI).
In contrast to a tension limitation by means of a corresponding work law definition, CRAC
assures that
• upon reaching the specified cracking strength, the transferable tensile force drops to zero.
• continued loading is accompanied by corresponding crack-growth.

General
With SFLA work laws for individual reactions of the spring material (→ SMAT) can be defined.
The work low describes the loading path under the uni-axial monotonic loading. The mate-
rial reaction under unloading and reloading conditions takes place according to the chosen
material type (→ SMAT MTYP).
These work laws consist of up to 20 (U,F) points with segments interpolated linearly or with
cubic splines. The input of of the points must be made in such a way that U is arranged in
monotonically ascending order.
Hint
Partial material safety factors are not considered separately; they must be incorporated
in the specified work laws.

ing defined curve point is assumed (linear perturbation). This holds both for tensile and
compressivebranchesofthecurve;acontinuationfromthetensiondomainintothecom-

TYPE
Depending on the link type (→ SMAT LTYP) the following reaction types TYPE8 are available:
STD (Standard spring):
P Spring normal force
PT Spring transverse force
M Spring moment
For the link types IHNG (Implicit Hinge) or PMM the following reaction types are valid:
N Normal force
VY Shear force Vy
VZ Shear force Vz
MT Torsinal moment Mt
MY Bending moment My
MZ Bending moment Mz
LEV
The formulation of a normal force-dependent reaction R (P-R interaction) is made possible by
defining a family of work laws. Each family of curves is therefore characterized by a defined
normal force reference level LEV9. The input of the reference level is carried out relative to the
link capacity SMAT P+/ P- (in [%] or as factor [−]).
Hint
The definition of a family of curves must take place according to the monotonically in-

Performance Limits
To categorize and simplify the evaluation of the link reaction (Performance), a work law along
thedeformationaxis canoptionallybedivided inarbitrarysections, alsoknow asPerformance
Intervals. The subdivision takes place by the definition of the Performance Limits, which mark
the interval boundaries.
The input of the performance limits is automatically adjusted to the actual work law definition

then defined with a unit of [−],[0/0] or [0/00] as factors for the corresponding values, and
are thus preset to 1.0[−]. The new cross section has no geometric properties any more.

When nothing is input for REF, the origin of the coordinate system of the cross section is
assumed to be at the elastic centre. This is of relevance for beams with a reference axis. The
required dimensions of the cross section can be calculated by AQB. For this task, B or H can

If the distance of the reinforcement layers (1) and (2) becomes greater than the limit
MaxBarDistanceT(350mm),additionalreinforcementatthesideofthewebwillbeintroduced

zero value for IT or a large value for AMAX, but then these sections will not be designable for
torsion any more. This layer (3) will be fixed unless a "‘:F"’ is appended to the RTYP literal,
then it might be increased for biaxial bending design.
The cover of the reinforcement from the side edge is preset to the minimum cover from the
upper or lower edge, but not larger than one-fourth of the width. It may be changed with item
SS.
Please note, that DIN 1045-1 uses the cover of the compressive reinforcement (effective dis-
tance - D/2) as a limit for the lever arm during the shear design of the cracked section. Thus
the diameter has always an effect on the shear design.

design tasks require to distinguish between the minimum and the provided reinforcements,
the definition should specify only the minimum reinforcements. The value may be specified in

or or as ratio in [-].

MRF = 0 must be specified for unreinforced concrete sections. The input of MRF or MRFL is
not allowed for steel or timber cross sections.
The torsional inertia and elastic torsional stress is always calculated based on the distribution
of the torsional moment on the web with the full height and the plate with a reduced width. To
avoidconstrainttorsionforconcreteconstructionstheeffectivetorsionalmomentofinertiacan
be reduced by IT explicitly or with the unit [%] to a relative value. A value of 0.0 is allowed but
may lead to kinematic systems.
For the equivalent hollow cross section used in computing the torsion reinforcement only the
web is used. The thickness of the equivalent hollow cross section is set to the minimum value
given by the double of the static cover of the upper and lower layer, but not larger than A/U. If

IfSPTisdefinedwithavalue+8,andthereinforcementintheplateisspecifiedwithintheouter

flanges.
By default, shear deformation areas are always computed – independent of the material type
– and accounted for consistently for beam analysis according to Timoshenko-theory. This
behavior can be overruled by explicit specification of the respective shear deformation areas
Ay and AZ with a value in (cid:2)m2(cid:3) or by a factor with the explicit unit of [%]. Specifying 0.0
deactivates the effect of shear deformation areas for the beam analysis.
The design of the transverse shear takes place at the most unfavourable location (neutral axis
orconnectiontotheplate). AdefinitionofSPTS3selectsoneoftheflanges,SPTS5or7both

Cable sections differ from circular sections in several reducing factors which are preselected
for the specific design code and the type of inlay:
FE = Fibre inlay
FEN = Natural fibre inlay
FEC = Chemical fibre inlay
SE = Steel inlay
SES = Steel cable inlay
SEL = Steel strand inlay
In the Eurocode EN 12385-4 appendix A to C the definitions of the factors are given:
Metallic cable section A m = C · d2
Minimum ultimate force F mn = K · d2 · ƒ r
Weight per length M = W · d2
In DIN 3051 part 3 the factors have been defined in a different way as:
Metallic cable section q m = ƒ · d2 4· π
Minimum ultimate force F mn = k · F r = k · q m · σ z
Weight per length G = q m · 

tion number. All subsequent input records describe this one cross section, which may consist
of several partial cross sections (external outline, inner perimeter, reinforcement arrangement
etc.). The input for each cross section ends either by the next SECT record, which can be
empty, or by the END record.
Freely defined cross sections are divided into three groups (see 1.1):
* solid cross sections
* thin-walled cross sections
* FE-sections
A coordinate system y - z is established for every SECT definition, the origin of which is in
general on the reference axis defined by the two nodes of a beam. All coordinate data of the
inputrecordswhichfollowaSECTrecordrefertothiscoordinatesystem. Thedirectionsofthe
axes are identical to those of the local beam element and defined in accordance with Chapter
2.1 (y to the left, z downward). The local coordinate axes y’ and z’ of a centric beam are only
shiftedparalleltothecrosssectioncoordinatesystem,sothattheoriginisattheelasticcentre
of the cross section.
Prestressing Tendons (AQBS, GEOS) always refer to the input coordinate system. It may be
appropriate to take this into account when selecting the zero point.
If desired, however, it is also possible to rotate the cross section by any angle or into the
direction of the principal axes (ALPH 999) as well as to translate it (items ALPH, YM and ZM).
For all rotations, it is not the reference coordinate system but the cross section elements that
are rotated. The definition of ALPH will force AQB to do the stress analysis for the rotated
principalaxissystem. TheinputofCTRLAXIS-2withinAQBhasthennoeffectonthissection
any more.
On the other hand a definition of FSYM YES will suppress the rotation of the principal axis
completely. This is intended for sections describing only half of a full symmetric section, but
mayhaveverydangerouseffectsifappliedtogeneralsections. ThevalueofIyzhasconsider-
able effects on deformations and also forces within constrained systems. This option enforces
also uni-axial bending (Vy=0, Mz=0) within AQB.
With BTYP you may specify your preferred beam element type for that section. This info may
be used for the mesh generation and the specification of minimum reinforcements.
For the design of a reinforced concrete cross section with AQB, it is always necessary, to
specify the location of the intended reinforcement - single, linear, or perimetric reinforcement-
by means of the records RF, LRF, CRF or CURF. Freely defined cross sections cannot be
dimensioned with STB/STBA. MRF defines the material number of reinforcement. Only if the
link reinforcement has a different quality of material a combined value is to be entered. Then
this combined value represents the default for the records CUT.
The material number should, in general, be specified by SECT. The declaration of a material

All cross section elements are addressed with an arbitrarily selected identification number,
which has up to four characters in general. In AQB and ResultViewer you may specify a mask
to select specific elements for the output. You might for example then select all elements with
a zero at the end.

The buckling curve ”e” may be input to select the old AISC-curve with the Euler hyperbola for
λ > 0.5 and a quadratic parabola for the plastic region. The safety factors have to be large
enough for this curve!
For ultimate plastic design according EN 1993-1-1 the interaction of the bending moments
requires to exponents α and β. As these factors depend strongly on the type of the section, it
is possible to define them explicitly or to chose from the two predefined formulas.
Hint
For some records (e.g. TVAR and PROF) it makes a difference if those records are
3-186 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA

defined within a section or separately. A definiton of SECT 0 will allow to terminate the
current section.
3.31.1 Parametric Sections
It is very common, especially in the bridge design, that very similar sections are derived from
a template. AQUA will therefore not only allow this parametric approach, but it will also store
the parametric information along with the cross section in the database, in order to allow easy
prototyping.
Primary solution for that task are formula expressions to be defined for any coordinate or per-
manentradius(CIRC,CRF)withupto256charactersintheformof ”=formula”. Theseformu-
las will be saved with the section and may be reevaluated for any section with different values
along an axis (see GAX/GAXP) or with explicit definitions locally with TVAR commands.
Formulas should use variables with a designated unit, only then the interpretation of #B+20
can be handled in a unique way. Simple cases may be also defined in the default sectional
units. As an alternate possibility the unit of the formula may be appended, but in that case all
the used variables must not have assigned a unit.
The following variables will be predefined for an axis:
#S_ACT The actual distance along the axis
#S_XI(x) Array of s-values of the support lines along the axis
#S_XI(2.5) is the S-value in the middle of 2nd and 3rd support
Then we may define coordinates relative to up to three other reference points. As a reference
you may use every stress point, polygon vertex, panel or circular element. The reference
is done via this explicit 4-character identifier. The specified coordinates are relative to that
reference. However if the coordinates are not a formula and either CTRL REFD 0 has been
specified or the reference is preceeded by an @ the coordinates are taken as absolute, which
is used for the export of sections.
It is also possible to specify the position of the reference point by an axis, for that case the
reference has to be specified as the ID of that axis with a colon prefix, e.g. ”:AX_0”. The local
coordinates (y,z) are then given by the 3D-distance to the same parameter on the reference
axis projected in the plane of the section.
Ifpointswithmultipleidentifiersarepresent,thenonlythefirstoccurrenceofthatpointisused
andtheothersareneglected. Ifareferencepointisnotpartofthesectionitself,youshoulduse
thematerialnumber0forit. However,youmayhaveanarbitrarynumberofnestedreferences,
i.e. a reference point may use a reference itself. For thin walled elements start and end point
may be addressed by a reference with an index.
As the references may be used on single points, start points and end points, the following
examples use a generic description. Thus REF holds for REFP resp. REFA or REFD.
Case 1: Carthesian References
• You may define the coordinates relative to the reference point in absolute Cartesian coor-
dinates y and z (left picture) by specifying:

For a derived instance the relative distance is kept as an absolute value or taken from the
given formula for this type of reference.
• You may define the coordinates relative to two reference points in absolute cartesian coor-
dinates y and z by specifying:
REF PTY PTZ
Now the y-ordinate is taken relative to PTY while the z-ordinate is taken relative to PTZ.
If a reference of only one coordinate is desired the reference of the other coordinate may
be specified as ’0000’ relative to the origin of the coordinate system. As shortcut it is also
possible to specify only a single reference with a preceeding > to inherit only the right
ordinate y or a ˆ for the elevation value (z).

The point PTD (at item REFD, RFDA or RFDE) defines the direction of the reference relative
to the PT0 point- Instead of a point it is also possible to specify the name of a variable or a
formula containing the angle of the direction in radians: ”=#VARNAME”

REF PT0 +PTD affine scaling only along direction

maintain the value perpendicular to that.

If three points are given, then the third point may be provided with a prefix operator defining

the line REF-RFD:
REF PT0 PTD >PT3 Distance (y)

REF PT0 PTD PT3 Perpendicular point
If for the first two cases the third point is specified as the point itself, this will create points with

Examples showing most of these features are given with AQUA31.DAT to AQUA33.DAT in the
example directory AQUA.DAT.
Hint
The offset definitions YM and ZM for SECT and POLY cannot be used as parameters.
3.31.2 FE-Sections
For advanced design tasks like a hot design it is not sufficient to describe the section just by
its outer contour. For such cases it is necessary to us a finite element mesh of the section.
These meshes may be generated by AQUA or may be imported from a secondary database.
The secondary database will contain in general also temperature distribution fields. It is also
possible to clone a section from the same database, which is especially useful for sections
with different reinforcement layouts based on the same thermal master analysis, performed
SOFiSTiK2023 3-189AQUA|InputDescription
only once. The defintion of the name ”SECT:nnn” will use a FE-mesh of this section nnn
directly. In that case an import of reinforcements via RF is also possible.
The section will be converted to single integration points given by the center of all QUAD ele-
ments. These may be imported group wise with POLY to specify any construction sequences
or in total if no such definition is made.
As this feature allows the evaluation of all sectional values for any type of section (e.g. sec-
ondarytorsionforasolidsection)itisthemostgeneraltypeofsectiondefinition. Alladditional
elements (Stress points, reinforcements, shear cuts) are defined as usual.
With the definition of LTAU the unit warping and the shear stress distributions will be saved to
the original database. So it becomes possible to view those results with WING/WINGRAF.

Figure3.42: ConstructionProcess
The picture above defines a construction process. As phase 21 has no impact on the section
itself it does not need to be defined. The same holds for any other construction phase like
pre-stress stages. The input scheme is given by:

This will generate 6 construction stages:

In general, these cross section properties will be computed automatically. You only have to
specify explicit deviations.
AK defines the area of the equivalent hollow cross section according to Bredt. This value
is used for determining the longitudinal reinforcement and the link reinforcement due to tor-
sion. However, in general AK should be defined implicitly by specifying the torsion resisting
reinforcements.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-193AQUA|InputDescription
An absolute value (0. or positive) can be input for IT. If a scalar value is input, the moment of
inertia computed by the program is multiplied by a factor. The value 0.5[−] or 50[%] results
in a cross section with 50 percent of the torsional moment of inertia.
YSC and ZSC can define a mandatory centre of rotation or, in case of only one value, a
restraining plane. The literal ’C’ can be used in both cases to set this ordinate to the value of
the center of the elastic centre.
If shear deformations are not to be taken into account, despite a detailed shear stress evalu-
ation, AY, AZ , AYZ and CMS should be set to ”0.” . The value 0.5[−] or 50[%] results in a
cross section with 50 percent of the calculated shear area.
For shear force dimensioning in state II, minimum lever arms can be specified with LEVY and
LEVZ, in order to obtain more economical results (e.g. 0.90d) or cover extreme cases (e.g.
moment=0). Values are definable as absolute values or as factors to the height or width of the
section.
For the analysis of creep and shrinkage effects an effective depth deƒƒ is required. This value
is defined by the area of the section A and the length of the periphery U which has air contact
by the formula 2A/U. The air contact ratio may be defined for the vertices of a polygon and for
circles. If not otherwise stated, outer peripheries will have a ratio of 1.0 and inner peripheries
of 0.0. However you may specify the value for every material within a section via record SV
explicitly.
For construction stages it is possible to define with SV MNO two factors for the elasticity and
the shear modulus. They will be mainly used for the evaluation of the sectional values. A
consistent treating in AQB for all effects is still under investigation.
In many practical cases it is recommended that the user defines his own plastic forces and
moments or limits the ones computed by AQUA if special considerations are to be taken into
account. The latter could easily be achieved either by a direct input of the plastic value that
shalldirectlyoverwritetheonecomputedbyAQUA,orbydefiningafractionalpartbymeansof
[-] resp. [%] in the frame of the CadInp language, thus scaling the default one. For example,
setting MBPL to 0.8[-] would result in AQUA using 80% of the originally computed plastic
bimoment. The default for each entry is 1.0[-] or 100%, i.e. unless explicitly defined by the
user, AQUA would not change the value of a plastic force or a moment.
Itisworthnotingthatonlycharacteristicplasticforcesandmomentscouldbedefinedoraltered
insuchaway. Ifso,AQUAwillproduceacorrespondingdesignvaluebydividingtheinputvalue
by the material safety factor.
If a composite section is present or a section whose material reveals anisotropic behavior
(different yield strengths in tension and compression), the meaning of NPLC and NPLT might
become of importance. In this case, AQUA would use the value of NPLT for the plastic axial
capacity in tension and NPLC for the fully compressed plastic section. For none-composite,
homogenous sections, only the input of NPLC is required and applicable to the entire section.

Unless a REC*-type has been selected, the record POLY must be followed by the input of the

has no effect. The polygon will be closed by the program automatically. In case of symmetry,
the polygon is extended by mirroring before being closed.

The distances between adjacent polygon vertices must be at least 0.0001 m. The polygon is
defined by the sequence of the vertices, not by their numbers. The number of points is limited
to 255 per polygon.
If a radius is specified, there are two possibilities:
• For tangential points (’TYPE TP’) a fillet is created at that vertex with the given radius. If
the radius is defined negative, a chamfer is created instead with the value of R used as a
distance along the edges (see picture below).
Only this input option of a fillet is possible for a cross section interpolation with references
along an axis.

• Without ’TYPE TP’ a tangential point (with a ’T’ at beginning of the name) is inserted be-
tween this (’E’) and the previously defined vertex (’A’) (see picture below). With an angle
> 120 degree two tangential points (’R’ and ’T’) and an additional midpoint (’S’) are in-
serted. An additional start point (’Q’) of rounding is inserted if the radius is less than the
half distance between the original polygon points. The inserted points get the reference of
the original polygon points. For this a new geometry point ’G’ with the original reference is
inserted. Then all new points are referenced to this geometry point.

Thus, a full circle section should be defined via CIRC or an explicit loop with trigonometric
functions.
Non effective areas can be defined by means of NEFF-areas, where parts of the polygons
within those areas become non effective for selected forces by the internal introduction of
deductional polygons.
Theoldmethodofshortcutswithinthepolygondefinitionsohouldnotbeusedanymore. There
non effective points are specified either with the definition of NEFF or INEF for the TYPE of
the vertex or by giving values for YEFF or ZEFF to introduce additional vertices at these limits
automatically. Reinforcement keeps effective.
The sectional values of the total sections are only used for the calculation of the area as well

contact of the whole edge the geometric mean value is used. I.e. if one of the two vertices of
an edge has the degree 0.0, the total edge will have this value. The values ’0.0’ and ’1.0’ are

WithaCUTonespecifiesapartofthesectiontobeusedforsheardesignand/ortheminimum
reinforcement or crack width of a partial section. The input of shear shear cuts is necessary
for the checking of shear stresses in concrete cross sections. Without input for CUT, up to two
axis parallel shear cuts are defined through the elastic centre (see CTRL STYP). As these do
not necessarily pass through the smallest width of the tensile zone, a warning is issued when
the user enters complicated polygons without shear cuts. It is the responsibility of the user to
define enough shear cuts to account for all unfavourable locations within a section.
The TYPE of the cut defines some important properties for the design. The following values
are available:
• ACT Only for the crack width design
• WEB Web of a cross section
WRED Web with reduced allowed strength
• FLAN Flange of a cross section
FFUL Flange with enhanced strength allowance
• INTE Construction interface
INDE indented shear interface
ROUG rough shear interface
EVEN even shear interface
SMOO smooth (very even) shear interface
The coefficients CINT and MUE are defined in EN 1992 or DIN 1045-1 (2008). For design
according to the old DIN 1045-1 (ch.10.3.6) the value CINT has to be specified with the
value of β ct > 1.
• SLAB Forspecialcases(e.g. hollowplates)itispossibletodesignacutofanysection
like a plate.
In general the definition of WRED / FLAN is expected to describe structured sections, while
WEB / FFUL is defining a compact section. There are some design tasks requiring the knowl-
edge of the minimum web thickness, which is found by scanning the shear cuts of type WEB.
For DIN 1045 (1978) this info is used to allow the shear region 3. However in this case, the
requested minimum height of 30 cm may override a definition here.
For DIN EN1992-1 this info is used to distinguish for the superposition of shear. WEB and

Figure3.47: SignDefinitionsforShearCut
A cut can be defined parallel to the axis by the input of YB or ZB only. In such cases the literal
S can be used for describing the location of the elastic centre.
However, the cut can also be defined by the input of multiple segments each with same identi-
fierNOandtwopoints(YB,ZB)and(YE,ZE).Theneverysegmentmaytreatadifferentmaterial
and shear link properties. Intermediate segments not cutting any part of the section are not to
be defined.
In this case some additional rules should be followed:
• A shear cut should always separate a complete part of the section.
• The separated part is on the left of the cut segment for CTRL FACE POS , where left is
taken relative to the direction A-E.
• The separated part is on the right of the cut segment for CTRL FACE NEG, where right is
taken again relative to the direction A-E.
3-204 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
• It is recommended to separate the simpler part of a section. Holes in the separated parts
as well as any additional other parts should be avoided. They may be properly detected
only if defined in the correct sequence.
• If there is biaxial bending there are two options, see further below!
Figures 3.48, 3.49 and 3.50 show sensible and adequate definitions of shear cuts when there
is predominantly uniaxial bending (load from M y+V z). In these cases CUT ... VYFK 0 could
also be defined explicitly in shear section definition in order to avoid numerical problems (due
to little biaxial bending).

Figure3.50: Shearcutsfortheinnerflange
If there is biaxial bending (M y+V z and M z+V y), there are two options.
1. By manually defining one of the two factors VYFK 0 or VZFK 0 a shear cut is clearly
defined for only one load direction:
• CUT... VYFK 0 → shear cut only transfers shear forces from V z
• CUT... VZFK 0 → shear cut only transfers shear forces from V y
Likethatnumericalproblems,whichwouldarisefromanareamomentofinertiaofalmost
0 (see next point 2!) are prevented in a simple way. This simplification can be used
therefore with a shear cut definition according to Figure 3.48 (shear cuts in the web) and
3.50 (shear cuts in the central flange) with CUT... VYFK 0.
2. The shear cuts have to be defined more elaborately because the user must assure that
theareamomentofinertianeverbecomes"0"(forthisneithertheleverarminy-direction
nor in z-direction must become "0"). This is the case when separated parts are always
entirely within one quadrant, which are defined by the main axes.

Figure3.52: Shearcutsforwebs
In Figure 3.52 the question about necessary stirrup reinforcement in the two webs is primarily
interesting. Theverticalpartialcutsthroughthebottomflangedirectlynexttothemainvertical
axis are only required to keep each separated part within a quadrant (the results/shear flows
in these partial cuts would only be decisive if a load M z+V y would predominate). The two red
partial cuts are defined with CUT NO 1... LAY 1 (in right web, 1st partial cut) and CUT NO
1... LAY 2 (in bottom flange, 2nd partial cut). The two blue partial cuts are defined with CUT
NO 2... LAY 2 (in bottom flange, 1st partial cut) and CUT NO 2... LAY 3 (in left web, 2nd
partial cut). Since the relevant point for the maximum shear reinforcement is not clear (since
it depends on the load), two shear cuts through each web are examined here as an example.
Similarly for an examination of the web above the main axes further seperated parts might
have to be defined, which would have to lie in the upper quadrants.

and it has to be assured that the sum of the factors is 1.0. If the center of the separated part
has the same ordinates that the center of the section, no shear can be calculated any more
based on the force method.
BMAX defines whether an equivalent hollow cross section should be used (e.g. for reinforced
concrete cross sections). If the half cut width is greater than BMAX, the found cuts are auto-
matically subdivided into two partial cuts, each of them processing the external width of the
equivalent hollow cross section. For cuts of type WEB or WRED, the automatic division into
two partial cuts is done even if no BMAX has been specified and:
• it is a simple cut with one input part on a simple cross section without any holes
• or the shear flow at both ends of the cut has an opposite direction.
The width of the equivalent hollow section is then set to half the web width.
The default of the width BMAX is derived from the defined data (material type, peripheral
reinforcements, Bredt-Area etc.) and some literals can be specified too:
3-208 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
EC The width is taken as the double value of the reinforcement cover, but not larger
than A/U or the effective wall thickness for hollow sections in accordance with EN
1992-1-1 6.3.2 (1).
DIN/LEON ThewidthisasECbutnottakenlessthanasixthofthediameterofaninscribedcir-
cle in accordance with F. Leonhadt und E. Mönning: Vorlesungen über Massivbau,

235 This determination fulfills the requirement of the National Annex DIN EN 1992-
1-1/NA NCI Zu 6.3.1 (1) for hollow sections with wall thicknesses limitation b/6.
SIA The width is as EC but not taken less than an eight of the diameter of an inscribed
circle.
Thepositionoftheactuallyinsertedtorsionreinforcementisnotknownhere,withtheexception
of the perimetric reinforcement CURF. Therefore, BMAX has to be defined explicitly, if the
specification = 2·(c+D/2) is to be fulfilled according to the design code.
If the value BMAX is not specified explicitly, the program tries to determine for unstructured
shear cuts the effective width iteratively according to the specifications of the design code
using the selected literals EC, DIN or SIA.
Since the engineer is free to choose the thickness BMAX according to EN 1992-1-1 or the
National Annex DIN EN 1992-1-1/NA, provided that the reinforcement is inserted only in the
centre, the upper limit A/U or alternatively d/6 should be observed in any case. Analog a
lower limit of 0.4·A/U is reasonable. An average value such as min(d ; 0.75·A/U) seems ideal,
since the choice of the equivalent hollow section with presumed reinforcement arrangements
involves numerous uncertainties.
BMAXwillnotbepresetforsteelortimbersectionsandmultiplecutsfromseveralCUTrecords.
An increase in this value results in a smaller equivalent hollow cross section, thus leading to
greater shear reinforcement but smaller shear stress.
But the width can be defined directly if needed, which might be necessary for very thin open
sections.
Design of the shear reinforcement only takes place for cuts when a genuine or an equivalent
hollow cross section has been defined.
The elastic stress will be calculated completely with the selected analysis method via CTRL
STYP. For the design of concrete the resulting shear flux will be obtained by the integral of the
stresses.
For the torsion the user may prescribe an explicit value with a definition of WTM explicitly. For
the force method or CTRL STYP BEM 1, this value will be preselected via Bredt’s area as
1/(2·AK·tef). Flanges which should not be designed for torsion have to be defined with WTM
0.0.
The maximumstress in a shearcut is onlyinformative in most cases. However, ifrequested, it
may be prescribed explicitly with WTD.
TheeffectivewidthfortheshearforcecanbereducedbyBRED.Thisisappropriate,forexam-
ple, when ungrouted ducts weaken the web and the width must be reduced accordingly.

The forces N and M perpendicular to the cut are only used to describe the stress. There will
benodesignforbendingandnormalforcewiththelinksaslongitudinalreinforcement. Thusa
tensile force may lower the required link area while the total steel area becomes higher.
Attention!
Incrackedstatethereinforcementisusedintheshearchecksonlywhenitissituatedinsidethe
separated polygon. In particular, a partial area without reinforcement leads to a shear stress
0.0 if it is in the tensile zone! Therefore we use a minimum shear stress which is taken from
the uncracked state and a reduction factor based on the lever arms.
The individual segments of one cut are treated separately during the design. The extreme
values of reinforcement of every shear cut, which are stored separately for each rank of links,
are always per physical section, the following rules apply:
• If a cut intersects multiple webs of an articulated section, the obtained reinforcement has
to be placed in every web, The total shear link area is n times the printed value for n webs.
• If a cut in a compact section intersects the equivalent hollow section twice, the reinforce-
ment is the double of the most unfavorable segment. This assures, that the total reinforce-
ment is computed by superposition of the shear and torsion components as required by
some design codes.
• Cuts having the same link rank enter the maximum value to the resulting reinforcement.
This value has to be place then in every segment. A typical case are multiple cuts for the
same web referencing the same shear link.
• Cuts having different link ranks enter the results separately for each rank with the corre-
sponding maximum. Different link ranks should thus always be used when different rein-

For a buckling design (c/t, section class 4) it is necessary to know the effective length c. This
value is defined for every plate by the location of the supports (FIXB, FIXE), which may be
defined by the following rules:
FREE the literal FREE defines a free end
SUPP the literal SUPP defines a supported end
>0 positive values define a support towards the interior of the plate
<0 negative values define a support outside of the plate. This feature is necessary to
describe fields subdivided in individual plates.

If the user does not specify distances explicitly, it will be tried to guess the support condition
and to combine consecutive plates to a single field if the following conditions hold:
- they are connected and do not have a bend
- donotdeviateofvalue’thickness*shearstiffness’morethanafactorof1.25(maybe
changedwithCTRLFIXL).Thisalsoappliestothethicknessoftheshearconnections
(WELD).
- is not interrupted by a special option TYPE NCHK or NNCH
- is not interrupted by a non effective area (NEFF or TYPE NEFF) with a length bigger
than the thickness. Shorter thin-walled elements are interpretated as screw holes.
- do not have stiffeners or welds (WELD) at the end points. As stiffener we declare all
plates intersecting with an angle greater than 45 degrees. The length of the plate has
no influence. A stiffener will move the location of the built-in face via the projection of
its half thickness plus the half minimum thickness of both connected elements (for the
weld seam fillet) to the inner of the plate.
For the automatic determination of the locations of the clamped edge of panel sequences the
panels be aligned the same, if necessary. With different input of the start end end points thus
individual panels are changed in the direction.

This element connects thin-walled section elements PLAT and PROF shear-resistant. It is
essentially not used for the sectional values. Thus one can describe:
- Longitudinal seams of welded joints (T > 0), with contributing to the torsional moment
and the shear forces
- Shear bonds in composite sections (T < 0)
- Trussed walls (T < 0)
For real welds the equivalent seam thickness is to be used for T. The element is then used for
the determination of the shear stresses in welds.
For bracing walls the effective thickness T is given through the shear stiffness Sd of the frame
divided by the product of the WELD-shear modulus and the length of the shear connection in
the section plane. T = Sd/(G·L)
In the case of a variable effective thickness a variable TVAR can be defined for T in order to
use it for the interpolation with a master cross section.
If NO is not specified, an internal sequential numbering takes place.
The coordinates of the end points must be placed exactly within 0.5 mm (or snap defined by
CTRL SDIV VAL2) to the end points of the corresponding elements.

The geometry of the shapes can be modelled only roughly. The most important data is the
weight of a single pile Z3 in kg/m and a few more dimensions. AQUA will create the locks
as equivalent solid sections such that the total area (based on a weight of 7850 kg/m3) is
achieved. Input of R1 is the half diameter of the lock (U-shapes only), R2 is the angle of the
web against the horizontal length of the wall and B2 may be used to specify the width of the
”upper” flanges. For the sheet piles the input for SYM defines:
none single pile
z-z Wall with 1 m width (locks not fixed)
o-o Wall with 1 m width (locks are fixed, only for U shapes)
3.41.4 Additional Descriptions
Profiles are primarily tabulated geometric types. Exotic shapes may be defined via explicit
valuesVDtoVR2. Butyouhavetospecifyabasictypeoftheshapeandthenormallyrequired
identifiers in any case. If you select non tabulated identifiers (e.g. HEM 172), all explicit
dimension values have to be specified.
Cold formed sections (CDS) may be defined as U, Z, C or OMEGA shapes by defining the
values of the width B and/or the grps T positive or negative:

This input always defines polygons or thin-walled section elements and not any fixed cross
section properties. Therefore the analysis of thin-walled section types is performed with small
deviations from the tabulated cross section values. For torsional values with very thin shapes
with significant fillets, more severe deviations may occur. The default for DTYP is changed to
T, if beforehand a thin walled element in that cross section has been defined. If the profile
is included (oartly or complete) in concrete (also core concrete) a hole in the surrounding
concrete is created automatically unless MREF is specified with zero.
If NO is not specified, internal sequential numbering takes place.
By default profiles are oriented with their legs in the direction of the y and z coordinate axes,
so that the y axis shows the larger moment of inertia. Channels (U-sections) are oriented with
their opening to the right. Angles (L-sections) stand like the letter L (height Z1, width Z2, but
the values can be interchanged). ALPH can rotate the cross section about the x axis. When
nothing is input for REF, the reference point of the shape (YM,ZM) is located at mid-height
for I- and SH-sections, left outside at mid-height for Channels, bottom left outside for Angles
and top middle for T-shapes. For centric beams REF C should be applied as with the GUI
default. The coordinates of these reference points and the angle of rotation may be defined
withreferenceto other points, buttheshapeandits sizeitselfmayofcourse notbeinfluenced
by other reference points of. The shapes can be coupled with other cross section elements,
butthenthetypeofelementmustmatch. Thusthinwalledelements(PANE,PLAT,WELD)may
be combined only with DTYP D profiles, while thickwalled elements are allowed with DTYP V
profiles, overlapping definitions with other materials will generate automatic holes. And it must
bekeptinmindthatthetransferofshearforcesforthinwalledprofilesisonlypossibleatends,
vertices, or at the centre point (I-sections and Channels). In case of solid cross sections the
edges must lie exactly on top of each other. As can be seen in the following example, the
bisected shapes must therefore be positioned on the outer edge of the other profile’s web.

Additional output points for normal and shear stresses or arbitrary geometry points may be
defined with SPT. The design for fatigue is only possible with those points. A stress point
will create its own stress results in the database visible with WinGRAF along a beam or may
be addressed in MAXIMA for the superposition of stresses at that point. For most cases the
evaluation of maximum stresses might be sufficiently performed with all polygon vertices and
the intermediate points of the thin walled elements.
If the user does not select stress points, automatic points may be created controlled by CTRL
SCUT. For construction stages it should be noted, that these points will be generated for the
finalsection. Ifthosepointswillbeinanoneffectivepartofthesectionforasingleconstruction
stages, no stresses will be obtained for those points.
The normal stresses can be calculated from the X and Y coordinates using Swain’s formula.

able effective thickness a variable TVAR can be defined for TEFF in order to use it for the
interpolation with a master cross section. Following possibilities for FIX are available:

With NEFF it is possible to define parts of polygons or an FE section or a thin walled section
to be non effective for different types of forces or moments. The default NYZ, deactivating all
longitudinal stress components is the correct choice for elements which are not effective at all
(e.g. local buckling). If the non uniform distribution of longitudinal stresses is to be modeled,
the normal force should remain effective. AQB uses the total section for the normal force due
to prestress and all creep and shrinkage evaluations. For the shear stiffness the total section
is used in all cases, but the non effective parts have a constant shear stress due to the non
existing longitudinal stress.
3-232 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
If no information is given for the reinforcement at TYPE, it is active in the non effective part (=
+R). An input +/-R for the reinforcement does not work with th especification DIST NONE for
the distribution of the bars.
For the bending parts it has to be distinguished if the Moment My or the lever z becomes zero
in Swain’s formula. SOFiSTiK uses always the lever, thus MY and MZ are just synonyms for Z
and Y.
In general the implemented method will generate multiple deductional areas if the windows
overlap, so this must be avoided.
For the definition of the NEFF-area it is possible to define the corner points (ymin,zmin) and
(ymax,zmax) of a rectangular window or with a specification of WIDT a rectangle along a line
from (ymin,zmin) to (ymax,zmax).
The NEFF window will create additional polygon vertices for the entries and exits points. This
option may be deactivated with an extra character "‘V"’ appended to the TYPE. For NEFFs
defined within a construction stages this option is always enforced.
For sections of class 4 the procedure in the design code deactivates the non effective areas
beforehand.

This can be facilitated by defining non effective areas in AQUA beforehand allowing a simple
stress check or even an interaction of ultimate forces in AQB.

For uni-axial bending the stress is defined by just two points on the principal axis hitting the
elastic center of the section.
But even for bi-axial bending the stress plane may be defined by just two points if we require
that the stress does not vary perpendicular to the connecting stress defining line. The exact
values may be obtained from an iterative analysis with AQB NSTR.

the Reynolds number and roughness and available within the programs. But there are some
explicit definitions possible (e.g. cables always with Cd = 1.2). As there are no directional

It is especially important to consider the exact definition of the coefficients, because the liter-

system is to align the y-axis in wind direction and the z-axis vertical to the top:
• The angle for load application is the angle against the (lateral) local y-axis of the cross
section. 0 degrees correspond to an angle from left to right in negative direction of the
y-axis, +90degrees frombelowto aboveindirectionof negativez-axis. This definitioncor-
responds to the normal designations, yielding forces in negative direction with the positive
signs of the force coefficients.

• The coefficients are be to determined from wind-tunnel tests or numerical flow simula-

separately. For torsion both dimensions are then used. Thus for the sectional coordinate

height or the width as reference for all coefficients. It has to be stated however, that this will
hamperaninterpolationandsomeoftheWPAReffects. Ifthevaluesarealltakenonthewidth,
a change of the height will not change any wind force. Many values specified in the literature
may be generalized easily if defined with the REF HB or BH. For the dervativa with HB or BH
and a rotation of WHB or WBH the value B2H is required.
For extended analysis it is also possible to define the derivatives according to Scanlan. For
every defined angle up to eight consecutive records with up to 27 data pairs may be defined.

All these values are thus referenced on the total chord width b. When importing data it has
to be taken care or the fact, that Scanlan used the half chord B and has used other indices
with the P  (P1 exchanged with P5 and P4 with P6). Then he used the heave downwards, so
the coefficients H2, H3, A1 and A4 are with opposite signs. Thus some of the values might be
corrected, adjusted or shifted.
The quasi static wind coeffecients and their derivatives may be used to create asymptotic
values of the curves for static loading (K=0). The user may select this assymptotic point by a
last point onyl with VRi.
The printout of the coefficients is done with ECHO WIND FULL in the notation of the Polytec-
nico Milano which provides a better visual control. With ECHO WIND EXTR it is also provided
in the Scanlan notation.

Longitudinal reinforcements are organized in groups by Layers. For the design all elements of
a single layer will be activated in total to achieve a useful distribution for all layers together.To
achieve this in a consistent manner, all elements of layer must have the same material and
type and should be activated in the same embedding material and construction stage. This is
achievedeasilybyspecifyingaLAYbeforedefiningtheelements. Thedefinitionofashorttext
(TID) may be used to clarify the location of the layer for the print. The default for TYPE is MIN
for Layer 0 and 9 for all other layers.
3.46.1 Properties of reinforcement elements
The reinforcement elements and its distribution are defined by means of five parameters. The
diameter should be always defined.
AS is the reinforcement base value (units see below)
ASMA is the maximum reinforcement in the same unit (if only ASMA is defined, AS
= ASMA will be assumed.)
LAY is the ident of the layer type (M for type MIN, S for type SEQ, Z for type OPT)
and the layer number (0-9).
The default is taken from the preceding LAY record.
D is the diameter of an individual bar, either in [mm]
or as nominal value in the form of a literal:
’5’ is for an US-design code a ’#5’ bar.
A is the distance between the bars or the number of bars.
DIST The distribution of the bars within the element
Ingeneral,allreinforcementsaresavedassinglebarstoallowunlimitedusageofthesections
for non linear design. Several possibilities for the distribution are available via item DIST.
EVEN generates a bar in the middle of all segments, thus all areas have the same
weight.
FULL generates bars at the start and end point and between
INS omits the start and end point.

ADJA omits the end point only.
ADJE omits the start point only.

With DIST NONE a continuously distributed reinforcement is created. Such reinforcement is
not recommended any more because some effects (eg. non effectivity) are not possible. With
DIST NONE a reinforcement/length is created with AS/A, where A is preset to 1.0. A total
reinforcement value may be obtained for this special case with A=0.0.
InallothercasesofDISTthevalueofAispresetwiththemaximumreinforcementbardistance
specified in the INI-file, respective a maximum distance of 400 mm. Negative definitions of A
will be taken directly as number of bars.
For the reinforcement area and especially to distinguish the behaviour with an interpolated
section three cases are distinguished, controlled primarily by the definition of a specific unit.

(cid:2)mm2/m(cid:3)

[−] defines a factor on the single bar with Diameter D
(Units [o/o] and [o/oo] have the same effect)
If AS is not defined, the total area of reinforcements will be obtained by the count on the
generated single bars.

3.46.2 Rules for the treatment of layers
The ratios of the layers to each other are controlled by the layer type. There are layers with
the minimum reinforcement (MIN, M0 - M9) and optional layers (OPT, Z0-Z9). M-layers have
minimum reinforcement and, in the absence of any other instructions, they are laid by at least
the specified AS values. On the other hand, Z-layers may be not activated at all. The layer
number has no influence on the selection of a particular layer by the dimensioning program.
ForidealsectionalvaluesinAQUAonlytheminimumvaluesofthereinforcementswillbeused.
If, however, processingin theorder ofthe layernumbers isdesired, the layernumbers S0- S9
shouldbeusedasaspecialcase. S-layerscannotbeusedincombinationwithM-orZ-layers.
As an exception to this rule, however, a minimum reinforcement can be defined for the lowest
layer by M0.
3-242 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
Each layer is allowed to have only one material number. For the further processing to be
consistent, it is also useful that every one layer lies only in one material number since only
then the right deduction areas or equivalent cross section values can be determined.
Reinforcement with the same layer number is always laid in proportion to the input AS-values.
In general each layer can only be increased to the value where its first reinforcement reaches
its maximum value.
The following principal options are available to the user:
- symmetric reinforcement
Compressionandtensionreinforcementaredefinedsymmetricwithrespecttotheelas-
ticcentreofthecrosssectionandwiththesamelayernumber. Minimumreinforcement
requires layer type M.
- non-symmetric reinforcement
Compression and tension reinforcement are assigned different layer numbers.
Torsional Longitudinal Reinforcement
The keyword TORS and the literal ACTI/ADDI can be used for each reinforcement element to
indicate that this reinforcement should be used for torsion. This has the following effects:
• During dimensioning, the required torsional longitudinal reinforcement is compared to the
total active (ACTI and ADDI) areas divided by the periphery length and is then made avail-
able with an increase of the involved layers. The torsional reinforcement elements do not
need to have the same layer number (e.g. top/bottom). In case of an increase due to tor-
sion, however, each layer is increased as a whole, including reinforcements not activated
for torsion.
• Only the reinforcements designated with ACTI define the equivalent Bredt’s box with its
area. AQUA establishes itself a reasonable sequence of the elements and checks the
defined area against the cross section area. The result may be checked as shear section
”AKT” in the ResultViewer. If needed you may change it with an explicit value with SVAL
AK.
The effectiveness of the reinforcement is defined either as linearly distributed reinforcement
directly in cm2/m or in the form of single points with discrete spacing. For the efficiency of the
entire box the entire effective reinforcement is distributed about the entire perimeter. Thus it is
theusersresponsibilitytocheckthatthepredetermineddistributionissufficientforthetorsional
loading.
Crack Widths
The item AR can be used for each reinforcement element in order to introduce additional
properties for checking the crack width. D specifies already the diameter for which the crack
widthmustbemaintained. ARdefinesthereferenceareaforasinglecheckofthecrackwidth,
as required for instance by DIN 4227 10.2 Section 3. Here AR defines the reinforcement ratio
μ-z by means of:

μ−z = (3.155)

CURF can be used to define circumferential reinforcement for the last defined polygon. The
distance may be defined by two components, a constant offset H and a variant cover defined
for the material with MEXT CNOM. Any input for EXP will add the value CNOM+D/2 for all
edges. If no CNOM is defined only H is used as true cover.
For the exposition class a match is defined using the wild card rules. Thus if all edges should
be treated a value of "‘*"’ or equivalent has to be specified. Any other definition will create a
reinforcementonlyforthoseedgesmatchingtheselectioncriteria. Thusitispossibletodefine
different reinforcements for different edges. The definitions for the distribution DIST will be
applied for any connected number of edges.
The value of A specifies the maximum distance of the generated single reinforcements. How-
ever, unless DIST INS, INSC or EVEN is specified, at least one reinforcement bar is placed at
eachcorner. ThemeaningofAS,ASMAmaybeprelength,intotalorbybarandarecontrolled
by the unit (eg. mm2 or cm2/m). If definition of A as number of bars is not possible here. The
use of the line reinforcement LRF with the radius R and the angle PHI is recommended for
polygonal circles instead of the perimetric reinforcement.

SOFiSTiK variables, defined via STO# or LET# are globally valid. For more complex tasks
like template section generation, it becomes necessary to define variables valid only within
a scope. TVAR allows a very general definition of those numeric variables within a freely
selectablescope. Thedefinitionofliteralsorthedefinitionoftablesorfunctionsisnotpossible.
TVARwithout thedefinitionofa scopesavesthe valueforthecurrent section. Thusthe useof
thisvariablebecomespossiblefortemplateformulasevenifthatvariableisnotdefinedglobally.
Multiple definitions should be used for very special cases only.
Variables used for a section have a complex hierarchy:
• Highest Rank have variables defined along an axis during interpolation along the axis.
• Secondaryrankhaveallvariablesdefinedinpublicscopes(0to99999),eitherwithCADINP
and LET# or with TVAR and an explicit scope.
• Finallyforallvariablesthedefault-valuewillbecomeeffective,whichisthevaluewhichhas
been defined at the time when the section has been created. If no other scope has been
used, this willbe the value defined with TVAR for the section. These values are saved with
the section in the database and will be updated with every INTE command.
The name of the variable may be followed by a simple numerical index:
TVAR INC(0) 0.05
TVAR ALF(0) ARC(ATN(+#INC,+1)) SCOP 1
TVAR ALF(1) ARC(ATN(-#INC,-1)) SCOP 1
ThereisarangeofVariablesintheEuro-codesallowingtoadoptnationalfactorscalledboxed
values. They are defined in the INI files in general. A survey of the accepted names and
subjects (DESI,COMB etc.) is given in the file master.ini.
For special cases, these values may be defined with TVAR. If for example a reduction of the
elasticity modulus for the CALC curve is required, it is possible to specify factors ALF-CE and

All sections marked as to be interpolated in the database, will be established if defining INTE
ALL (or INTE 0). Depending on the specification of NREF, only sections along that axis or
along all available axis (no definition) will be treated.
There are two different types for interpolation of cross sections:
• Linear interpolation between two cross sections whose construction is identical
To avoid interpolation problems, it is recommended to generate the second cross section
by a copy of the first one for the method of the linear interpolation. In Rhino projects, the
formula evaluation is suppressed by INTE ALL 4.
• Interpolationofthecrosssectiongeometryofamastercrosssectionusingreferencepoints
and variables along the axis
ThisoptionisavailableonlyforcustomerswithaCABDlicense. Fortheinterpolationalong
an axis, only a master cross section is required. Variable points (reference points) are
definedinthissectionandcanbeassignedtocorrespondingvariables(TVAR)/axes(pro-
gram SOFiMSHC record GAXV).
It is not possible to mix both variants. In the case of inconsistent definitions AQUA prints a
warning and tries to interpolate with the master cross section.
When performing this action AQUA will use free section numbers above 100 and above the
cross section template for the new sections. These sections are deleted and reassigned if this
procedure is repeated and will be printed in detail only if ECHO SDEF EXTR is given. In the
case of an interpolation with a master cross section, the numbers of the interpolated cross
sections can be influenced as follows:
• The master cross section has to be numbered 100 or greater.
• Theinterpolatedcrosssectionsstartthenwiththenumberofthemastercrosssection+1.
E.g. if the master cross section receives the number 200, then the interpolated cross sections
start with number 201.
INTE will change the coordinates either by interpolation with a second section or by variables
3-254 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|AQUA
alonganaxis. Inasecondstepalldefinedreferencerulesofthemastersectionwillbeapplied.
All non geometric data is taken from the master section. Thus the interpolation between two
sections will not necessarily be identical if the sections are exchanged.
AQUA will check the generated sections against duplicates and may use a section multiple
times. A definition of INTE ALL 1 will suppress this behaviour.
It is also possible to interpolate typed standard sections.
The construction stage numbers of the generated sections may be changed. The definition of
avariableCSI_SELECTi(i=1...9)definesanewconstructionstagenumberfortheith construc-
tion phase. All following construction phase will be shifted by the same value if not explicitly
defined with another CSI_SELECTi definition.
Individual sections may be also directly interpolated or derived or inserted in the current sec-
tion. For the elements to be inserted there is:
• Just copy a section definition. For a cross section template currently defined variables
(TVAR) may be evaluated. This method is selected by entering NS0 only.
• You may use linear interpolation between two sections having an identical layout. For this
methodtwocrosssectionnumbersandaninterpolationfactorS(0forNS0,1forNS1)have
to be stipulated.
• Last but not least you may extrude a cross section template NS0 with reference points
alongageneralcurvedaxis. ThisisselectedbyenteringareferenceNREFoftheaxis,the
common station value S for all the axes and the reference cross section NS0.
• If NO is defined positive a new section will be generated.
• IfNOisdefinedasLiteralADD,analreadydefinedornewlyinterpolatedsectionsectionwill
be inserted within the current section definition. This is especially useful for those cases
where sections exist from a general import and have to be amended with additional data.

section. (cross section moduli, partial cross section areas, etc.).

of inertia and the locations of the principal axes are output.
Crosssectionpropertiesarealsoreleasedseparatelyforeachmaterialinthecaseofcompos-

unrestricted effective cross section are also released.
Some analysis methods, eg. a 2nd order theory of a linear calculation of steel structures (see
manual of program STAR2, record GRP, item SECT, page 3-6), require that the stiffness to
be reduced by the safety factors referenced to the reference material. In case the materials
have safety factors, this would result in totally different values for composite cross sections.
Therefore an extra table for the design sectional values is output.
For the detailed output of cross sections it is important to know, if it refers to a restart. This
is because in such a case only the newly defined cross sections get printed out. Even in the
case, however, one can output all the cross sections with ECHO SDEF FULL.
