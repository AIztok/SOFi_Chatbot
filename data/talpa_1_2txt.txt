1 Task Description
TALPA offers two program modi that are selected by the literal TASK.
CSG The Construction Stage Manager Geotechnics allows for automatic generation of
the analysis sequence, based on an intuitive description of the construction stages.
FEA Finite Element Analysis - actual calculation of the analysis steps (construction
stages) by means of the Finite Element Method.
1.1 Construction Stage Manager (CSG)
Executed in mode CSG, TALPA supports the automatic generation of a analysis sequence,
based on an intuitive description of the single construction stages. The actual calculation is
then executed in mode FEA.
Description of the construction stages is based on element groups and the philosophy that
only changes in relation to the previous construction stage (e.g. installation, removal, change
of properties of element groups) are specified. Groups that remain unchanged (and therefore
are based on the foregoing construction stage), are treated automatically.
InCSG-modeinputrecordsCSYS,CCRL,CS,CGRP,CLOA,CGWandECHOareevaluated.
1.2 Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
In FEA mode TALPA allows for linear or non-linear analysis of stresses and deformations both
for
• arbitrary shaped plane structures that are loaded in-plane (plane stress or plane strain
conditions)
• and axisymmetric three-dimensional structures
by means of the finite element method. The main focus of TALPA is the numerical analysis of
geotechnical related taks and soil mechanics.
The analysis requires a descretized system (splitting of the structure into an assembly of indi-
vidual elements interconnected at nodes) that is stored in the data base. TALPA features the
following element types:
• planar continuum elements
• beam elements
• spring/ interface elements
• cable elements
• truss elements
All element types offer various optional nonlinear effects, allowing for an effective and realistic
capturing of relevant mechanical effects regarding the structure’s load carrying characteris-
tics. This involves in particular interaction between soil and structural members including wall-
friction and nonlinear load carrying characteristics of soil. Other important aspects, to name a
SOFiSTiK2023 1-1TALPA|TaskDescription
few, are load transfer via (grouted) anchors, load redistribution capabilities of geo-grids, yield-
ing/ tensile failure of struts, formation of plastic hinges and nonlinear load carrying behavior of
(reinforced) concrete members.
The program handles structures with rigid or elastic types of support. Elastic support can be
providedlinearlydistributedorpoint-wise. Additionally,rigidelementsorskewsupportscanbe
taken into account.
TALPA calculates the effects of nodal, line, block and temperature loads. The program con-
tainsspecialcapabilitiesforthegenerationofloadsfromconstructionstagesorprimarystress
states.
The program supports numerous non-linear material models (e.g. elastoplastic, viscoplastic).
Accounting for non-linear support effects, such as friction or slip, is possible, as well.
Program control is essentially done via a free format text input file, allowing for parametrized
input and supporting various data generation capabilities (CADINP scripting language).
Essentialcomputationalresultsarestrictlystoredinthedatabaseandarethereforeaccessible,
e.g. for graphical postprocessing. he output includes the nodal deformations, the stresses at
the centroids of elements and nodes and the reaction forces additional to the input.
The analysis of nonlinear systems is a demanding engineering task. The increased sensitivity
ofthesesystemsputsahighdemandonmodelingissues. Moreover,particularcharacteristics
of the finite element solution procedure are likely to become evident. Therefore, it is generally
advisable to increase the analysis model’s complexity gradually. Hence, as a rule, prior to
running a nonlinear analysis, system and loads should be validated by a plain linear analysis.
Engineering assessment of the computed results is indispensable.

2 Theoretical Principles
2.1 Introduction
PlanesystemsarelocatedintheplanespannedbytheX-andY-axesofacartesiancoordinate
system. This system is right-handed; a positive rotation is therefore defined by a clockwise
rotation of X about the Z-axis (view corresponds to positive Z-direction). Plane systems are

loaded in-plane, exclusively.
2.2 Analysis Models
TALPA supports three basic analysis models:
• Plane strain state
Thetotalstrainnormaltothestructure’splaneiszero. Thethicknessoftheplanarelements
defaults to 1.0 m. Orientation of the coordinate system can be chosen arbitrarily; however,
it is common practice to have the global Y-direction aligned with the gravity direction.
• Axial symmetry
Thismodelallowsfortheanalysisofaxisymmetricstructuresunderaxisymmetricloads. In
thiscase,themeshrepresentsameridionalsection,rotatingabouttheXaxis. Theanalysis
is based on a circular element spanning an angle of 1 rad. Essential characteristics of the
axisymmetric analysis model are:
– The appearance of a circular strain.
– Supports in Y-direction are not a necessary condition for a kinematically stable system.
– ThedimensionofnodalloadsisnolongerkN,insteadkN/mcircumferenceisused. Line
loads change from kN/m to kN/m2 and bedding constants from kN/m2 to kN/m3.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-1TALPA|TheoreticalPrinciples
– Beam elements cannot be used together with axisymmetric elements.
• Plane stress state
The stresses perpendicular to the structure’s plane are zero (e.g. building walls). Orienta-
tion of the coordinate system can be chosen arbitrarily; however, it is common practice to
have the global Y-direction aligned with the gravity direction. Friction materials (soil materi-
als) are not a valid option for this model.
2.3 Elements
2.3.1 Truss and Cable Elements
Truss and cable elements can only transmit axial forces. In order to restrict the cable reaction
to tensile force transfer, a nonlinear analysis is required.
Optional nonlinear effects are:
• Initial slip (GAP)
• Tensile failure upon reaching tensile rupture force (CRAC)
• Yielding (YIEL)
• Reaction according to a specified material work law (AQUA: SSLA).
Hint
When simulating a loading history using primary states, the following should be consid-
ered:
GAP is related to the total deformation of the element.
CRAC Straining beyond the element’s tensile strength yields to an immediate drop of
the tensile capacity to zero. This damage cannot be recovered, tensile forces
are no longer transfered by the element – even after a complete load reversal.
Continuing loading yields crack growth. Compression cannot be transfered
unlessthecrackhasclosedcompletely,i.e. thetotal deformationmustbecome
negative.
2.3.2 Spring Element
Spring elements can be used to model parts of the structure through a simplified force - dis-
placement relationship. This is usually a linear equation characterized by a spring constant:
P=C· (2.1)
The spring is defined by its direction (DX, DY, DZ) and the spring constants. The direction can
be specified as the difference of two nodes (NE - NA) or given explicitly. Support springs (one
node is referenced, only) must be assigned a direction.
The spring element provides for subsequent optional nonlinear effects:
• Initial slip (GAP)
2-2 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|TALPA
• Tensile failure upon reaching tensile rupture force (CRAC)
• Yielding (YIEL)
• Limitation of lateral force transfer by friction μ and/ or cohesion c
• Reaction of principal and/ or lateral spring according to a general force based response
curve (AQUA: SFLA)
Non-linearoptionsareeffectiveforboththerotationalandthetranslationalsprings. Aprestress
changes the corresponding effects and always induces a load to the system. A prestressed
spring will unload in the absence of external loading or constraints.
Hint
Whensimulatingaloadinghistoryusingprimarystates,theelementreactioniscontrolled
by the same directions as already given in subsection 2.3.1 Truss and Cable Elements.
Figure2.2: Standardnonlinearspringresponsecurves
Lateral spring action
An optional lateral spring stiffness c q acts isotropically in the plane for which the normal di-
rection coincides with the principal spring’s direction (lateral direction). The force component
in lateral direction P q is obtained from the corresponding lateral displacement component  q
according to:
P q =C q· q (2.2)
In case of activated friction or cohesion, the lateral force transfer is limited in dependence of
the actual principal spring force P by:
|P q|<=P·μ+c (2.3)
Friction or cohesion can only be effective, if a lateral spring stiffness is defined. In case the
principal spring experiences failure, the lateral spring becomes ineffective, too.
All spring nonlinearities are effective for a nonlinear analysis, only.

2.3.3 Rigid Frictional Interface Element
RigidFrictionalInterfaceelementscanbeusedtosimulatethecontactconditionsbetweentwo
mechanically interacting bodies of a model. Common use cases in geotechnics include soil-
structure interaction, modeling of the interface between distinct soil layers, the slip surface of
an unstable slope etc.
2Dinterfaceelementstopologicallyconsistoffournodesandarecharacterizedbyaverysmall
thickness to length ratio, being ideally zero-thickness elements in the unloaded configuration.
Therefore, two edges are formed, with the edge defined between the first two nodes being
the interface edge, which lies on the side where the interface is defined. The local coordinate
system is defined with local x-axis perpendicular to the interface edge and pointing towards
theoppositeedge(Fig. 2.3). 2DRigidFrictionalInterfacescanbegeneratedalongastructural

local x-axis, and a shear one, along local y-axis (Fig. 2.4). Their material properties can be
defined with the use of record AQUA: BMAT. The initial stiffness of interface elements is ex-
pected to be very high, compared to the surrounding elements, in order to ensure an initial
rigidconnectivitybetweenthetworegions. Insteadofexplicitlydefiningstiffnessconstants,the
elements may derive their stiffness by the Young’s and Shear Moduli of the material associ-
ated with the bedding properties. This is possible by defining a reference thickness H, which
correspondstothefinitethicknessofthephysicalmatterthattheinterfaceelementsrepresent,
despite their zero (or other) thickness on the generated mesh. An additional reduction of the
shear strength may be applied, with the use of the corresponding factor RFAC.
Hint
If parameter H is not provided, then an appropriate finite material thickness is calculated
internally, which will provide quasi-rigid but numerically robust interface elements. The
automatic determination of interface material thickness is recommended.

As a general rule, however, the contact conditions along an interface are described by a non-
linear material behavior. The element’s reaction in axial direction is governed by a material
model characterized by brittle tensile failure, while compressive stress transfer is unlimited.

2.3.4 Beam Element
Three different choices are available for beam elements. In all cases, the element obeys a
linear geometry, topologically definedby startand endnodes, respectively. Timoshenko beam
theoryisthebasisoftheelementformulations;accordingly,sheardeformationsareaccounted
for. Processing of optional hinge effects at the beam ends is incorporated in the formulation,
as well. Details regarding control options for the various beam types are given in the input
description, record CTRL BEAM. Subsequently, a short summary of important characteristics
is given.
Extended Beam Element (Default)
Extended finite element beam formulation (Timoshenko). In particular, allows for
• Implicit hinges (=beam hinges with assigned work law).
• Haunched cross-sections.
• Extended scope of beam load types (e.g. single forces).
• Variable number of beam sections.
Fiber Beam Element
The linear properties are almost identical with those of the ’Extended Beam Element’. Beyond
that, internal discretization of cross-sections into single ’fibers’, directly integrates the contin-
uum mechanical material reaction (stress-strain) into beam theory. Important characteristics
are:
• Optional nonlinear material reaction for steel and concrete materials.
• Damage model for crack evolution in concrete.
• Account for the steel-concrete bond action in between cracks (tension stiffening).
• Temperature dependent material degradation: ’Hot’ work laws + nonlinear temperature
strain according to EN 1992-1-2:2004.
• 100% compatibility with primary states (initial loading states).
The fiber beam element has been designed particularly for application in material nonlinear
analyses. For this reason, the underlying formulation abandons provision for a particular so-
SOFiSTiK2023 2-5TALPA|TheoreticalPrinciples
lution with respect to beam loads. Accordingly, an element discretization (h-discretization)
adequate to the nature of the problem under consideration is required - just as it is for other
element types.
Limitations of the element:
• Fiberdiscretizationiscurrentlysupportedforrectangularcross-sectionsoftypeSREC,only.
• Beam excentricities/ excentric cross-sections are not supported.
• No support of imperfection loads and prestressing loads.
• Implicit hinges (= hinges with underlying work law) cannot be assigned to a fiber beam
element.
Standard Beam Element
Efficient two-dimensional ’standard’ beam element (Timoshenko) with a prismatic cross-
section. The scope of permitted beam load types is limited. Linear material behavior, only.
Haunches are accounted for in an approximate manner based on averaged cross-sectional
values.
2.3.5 Plane Continuum Finite Elements
TheSOFiSTiKdefaultansatzfora2Dcontinuumelementisbasedontheconceptofenhanced
assumed strains (EAS). The essential characteristics of this ansatz are shortly motivated and
described in the following.
Geometry of the plain element is topologically described by 4 nodes in the element corner
points (QUAD). The standard ansatz space of a corresponding isoparametric element formu-
lation using bilinear ansatz functions provides for relatively limited kinematics of the element,
only. Asanimportantconsequence,atendencytowards’locking’canbeobservedforelements
of this type. The well-known example of a QUAD element subjected to centric planar uniaxial
bending illustrates this behavior. The element’s bilinear function space for the displacements
is not able to reproduce the bending kinematics accurately - resulting in parasitic (unphysical)
shear strains that induce a significant artifical stiffening of the element’s response. This effect
is commonly known as (shear) ’locking’.
Toalleviatethisproblem,normallyastrongrefinementoftheelementdiscretizationisrequired.
Alternative, more efficient, options to overcome the phenomenon are
• a)asufficientincreaseoftheorderoftheelementansatzspace(=moredegreesoffreedom
per element), e.g., using ansatz functions for the displacements of quadratic, cubic and
higher order;
• b) an element technological, internal enhancement of the element kinematics.
Methods falling in class b), have received great attention also adressing the issue of efficient
shellelementformulations. Thistriggeredthedevelopmentofnumerousstrategiesforelement
enhancement.
The Enhanced Assumed Strain approach
ThebasicideaoftheEASconceptisbasedonthenotionthatparasiticstrainsareresponsible
for the observed locking effects. As a consequence, the EAS directly aims at enhancing the
2-6 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|TALPA
ansatz space for the strains by terms that are not directly induced by the ansatz for the dis-
placements (assumed). This is done in such a way that the parasitic strains, possibly induced
by the insufficient ansatz space for the displacements, are compensated (eliminated) by the
assumed strains...
It can be shown that it is permissible to derive an element local formulation of the assumed
strains - provided that certain constraints are considered (Simo and Hughes [1] and Simo and
Rifai [2]). The essential benefit is: Elimination of the additional degrees of freedom corrspond-
ing to the enhanced terms already on element level, i.e., they do not add to the global number
of system unknowns (→ efficiency)!
Further benefits:
• Choice of element ansatz not required until computation; no remeshing required in case of
changes.
• MPC’s(multipointconstraints)thatallow,e.g.,forconsistentconnectionbetweenquadratic
and linear elements, are not required.
• In contrast to many other approaches for element enhancement, adoption of the EAS con-
cept in a nonlinear framework is rather straight forward and can be achieved with minor
overhead, only.
The well established Wilson/Taylor element with so called "incompatible modes" is a special
case of the more general EAS concept (Simo and Rifai [2]).
Optionally,theEASansatzcanbesuppressedviaCTRLoptionQART0. Inthiscase,element
behavior is controlled by isoparametric bilinear ansatz functions.
Thenon-conformingtypesaresuppressedinthecaseoftriangularelements. Forgeneralload-
ing states these elements are of very limited use since they show a strong tendency towards
shear-locking - resulting in a far too stiff prediction of the system response. The adoption of
this element for the analysis of general type problems is discouraged.
For additional reading regarding this topic see, e.g., Bischoff [3] or Klinkel and Wagner [4].
Various state-of-the-art nonlinear continuum material laws are available. For details, please

2.4 Preliminaries on Nonlinear Material Modeling
2.4.1 Primary states (initial stress states)
Primarystates(primaryloadcases)arefrequentlyusedinnonlinearanalyses,inparticularthey
are the standard means for the numerical simulation of staged construction processes. To this
end, an already reached system state is adopted as primary state for the directly succeeding
computation step (construction stage).
Moreover, the load carrying behavior of soils is often characterized by pronounced nonlinear
reactions, which also introduces a certain sensitivity with respect to the loading history. For
example, for the current reaction it makes a difference, wether previous unloading has been
encounteredornot. Alsohere,theadoptionofprimarystateshelpstoadequatelysimulatethe

The basic concept of primary states is subsequently illustrated ba means of a finite element
subjected to uniaxial compression.
Nodal balance of forces (equilibrium)
• We assume, that a (compressive) element stress state is given (red).
• Then, inherent internal nodal forces (=expansive forces) are obtained via integration of the
stresses over the element domain (green).
• Balanceofforces: Ifexternalnodalloads(blue)ofsamemagnitudecounteracttheinternal
nodal forces at each node of the element, the element is in a state of equilibrium.

a) For the current computation step, the same external loads apply as for the referenced
primary state. Balance of forces then yields a resulting force vector with zero magnitude
(assuming, the referenced primary state represents a state of equilibrium). The element is
in a state of equilibrium, no further deformation/ change of stress evolves.
b) Currently applied external loading has changed in comparison to the referenced primary
state. The resulting force is no longer of zero magnitude. In consequence, a change of
deformation/ stress state will occur.
c) No external loading in the current computation step is applied, e.g., due to deactivation of
adjacent elements and consequential loss of nodal reset forces. Then, the resulting force

The same observations apply for a complex finite element model. If some elements are re-
moved from a primary state configuration - including the corresponding loads - the original
equilibrium is disturbed and unbalanced forces emerge at the boundary nodes of the removed
parts.
In real problems either part only of the loading is used, or the primary state is reduced (relax-
ation, stiffness reduction method), or parts of the system are removed, replaced or modified
regarding their stiffness. In all cases, corresponding unbalanced forces evolve, initiating load-
ing or unloading response of the structure. In order to cover all situations encountered in
practice, TALPA features flexible and element group specific options for control of the various
scenarios (see record GRP).
2.4.2 The in-situ stress state
For geotechnical analyses with the finite element method, it is usually required account for the
in-situstressstateofthesoil(i.e.,thesoil’sstressstatepriortobeginningofconstructionwork).
Sincetheloadcarryingbehaviorofsoilsisoftencharacterizedbypronouncedinelasticbehav-

whereasthehorizontalstress isobtainedviathelateralearthpressure coefficient K according
to
σ h,0 =σ ,0·K . (2.4)
To generate a corresponding initial loading state of the finite element model, two procedures
SOFiSTiK2023 2-9TALPA|TheoreticalPrinciples
PLF LF xx
FAKP
FAKL
Figure2.7: Initialstressstatetransfer: unbalanced(residual)forces
are available:
• The K-procedure (computation under gravity loading).
• The analytical primary state (prescribing stresses analytically).
Parameters describing the initial stress state are assigned element group wise. For this pur-
pose, the input parameters K, as well as GAM, GAMA, H, SIGN and SIGH are available (cf.
GRP).
K-procedure
Using the K-procedure, a standard finite element computation of the model subjected to spec-
ified external loads (i.e. gravity loading) is executed. The procedure is activated by specifying
the lateral earth pressure coefficient K, only – input of GAM, GAMA, H, SIGN and SIGH is not
applicable, in this case.
The procedure is based on a temporary modification of the linear-elastic material properties.
Assuming laterally constrained conditions, the constitutive law is adjusted such that the de-
sired stress ratios K = σ h,0/σ ,0 of horizontal and vertical stresses are achieved. Essential
characteristics of the procedure are:
• The procedure is universal, no particular model geometries like horizontal soil surfaces or
horizontal soil layer interfaces are required.
• After successful computation, the obtained stress state represents a state of numerical
system-equilibrium.
• The lateral earth pressure coefficient is not limited to values K <1.0.
• Computation of the corresponding element groups for this loading step should normally be
carried out nonlinearly (SYST PROB NONL). Further, a combination with the option GRP
... PLC ’SITU’ is recommended. This assures that the computed stress state is compatible
2-10 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|TALPA
with material strength properties and possibly also provides for a consistent calibration of
the material internal state variables. In case significant local strength violations already
take place in this initial stage (plastic stress redistribution), a split into two computation
stepsmaybefeasible: AlinearlycomputedloadstepusingtheK-procedure,supplemented
by a second, nonlinear load step which references this primary stress state. Doing so, the
secondloadstepservesasacorrectorsteptoaccountforthenonlinearmaterialproperties
(limited material strength).
Hint
For generation of the initial stress state, use of the K-procedure is encouraged. Due
to its universal applicability, it is also adopted as the standard procedure for the TALPA
Construction Stage Manager mode (TASK CSG).
Analytical primary state
This procedure internally combines two substeps as follows:
• First,asystemstressstateisgeneratedpurelyanalytical,basedontheprovideduserinput
(see below). This means, initially, no finite element computation is executed.
• Inasecondstep,afiniteelementcomputationwithgivenexternalloads(gravityloading)is
executed, based on the so-obtained analytical stress state as primary state.
This second step follows exactly the same lines as an ordinary computation step with primary
loadcase: transferofstressstateandinternalforcesfollowstheproceduredescribedinsection
2.4.1. In this case, however, the initial stress state is not inherently derived from equilibrium
considerations but defined by analytical means. Therefore, attention is required: the imposed
stress state and activated external loading should represent a balanced state of equilibrium -
otherwise the emerging unbalanced forces will trigger a succesive system reaction with corre-
sponding stress redistribution effects. For this reason, when using the analytical primary state
approach, the resulting system state should be checked carefully.
Computation of the analytical stress state procedes as outlined in the following (cf. Figure
Figure 2.8). The vertical stress portion σ ,0 is determined for each associated element of
the designated group from the stress SIGN acting at a reference height H (global coordinate,
positive in gravity direction) and a depth position dependent increase via GAM/ GAMA:
σ ,0 =GAM·(t−H)+SGN (2.5)
The horizontal stress component is obtained via
σ h,0 =K·σ ,0+SGH . (2.6)
In the example of Figure 2.8, the vertical stress component acting at level H2 (upper edge of
group 2) is determined by
SGN2=GAM·(H2−H1)+SGN1 . (2.7)
This value has to be provided as input parameter SIGN for group 2 along with H = H2. Us-

Hint
The parameters GAM/ GAMA logically correspond to the specific weight parameters
GAM/ GAMA of the respective materials, they should therefore have the same value –
however, computationally they are independent. This may require special consideration
regarding the definition of element groups.
2.4.3 The initial pre-consolidation stress
Soils that have been subjected to a historically higher loading than present are termed over-
consolidated. The pre-consolidation stress identifies the corresponding historic loading level.
The degree of over-consolidation is commonly expressed by the over-consolidation ratio OCR
as the ratio between the maximum historical effective vertical stress σ(cid:48) and the in-situ effec-

2.4.4 2-phase model
Undrained Soil
Soil is a porous material consisting of solid particles which together represent the grain skele-
ton. The pores can be filled with fluid (commonly water) and air. Hence we talk about soil as a
three phase system (Figure 2.10).

Figure2.10: Soilasthreephasesystem
2-14 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|TALPA
For quasi-saturated soils, an explicit consideration of the air volume V  (Figure 2.10b) can be
neglected and a corresponding 2-phase approach can be established. The 2-phase model
explicitly accounts for (excess) pore water pressure p  and effective stress σ(cid:48) acting on the
grain skeleton. It relies on Terzagi’s principle of effective stresses
σ =σ(cid:48)+p  , (2.15)
where σ denotesthe totalstress. Combining thiswiththe assumption ofundrainedconditions,
i.e. flow of pore water is prevented, a relation between volumetric change and change of
pore water pressure can be derived. Together, this facilitates a differentiated simulation of the
evolutionofporewaterpressureandeffectivestress. Detailsofthemodelaregivenin(AQUA:
NMAT, TYPE UNDR).
The 2-phase model is activated by assigning undrained or drained conditions via the group
control GRP TYPE UNDR/ DRAI.
Undrained Effective Stress Analysis using Effective Material Parameters
When undrained material parameters are defined and the undrained analysis is activated (cf.
GRP TYPE) the stiffness of the pore water is automatically added to the stiffness of the soil
skeleton.
Distinction is then made between the effective stresses Δσ(cid:48) and pore pressures Δσ , which
are saved separately in the data base.
The second part of the Terzaghi’s principle states that all quantifiable effects of the changes
in soil stresses (e.g. volume changes, shape changes, shear resistance) are a direct conse-
quenceofachangeineffectivestressesσ(cid:48). Asarepercussionofthisstatement,thenon-linear
soil analysis according to the method described in this subsection is based solely on the ef-
fective stresses σ(cid:48) and the effective strength (e.g. φ(cid:48), c’) and stiffness parameters (e.g. E(cid:48) ,
ν(cid:48)).
Figures 2.11 and 2.12 show typical results of the consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial test for
the normally consolidated (NC) and the overconsolidated (OC) clay samples. It is a know
fact that the most real soils will experience some change of the volume when subjected to
shearing under drained conditions. In the undrained conditions the soil is prevented from
volume change and the tendency of soil to change the volume due to shear will manifest itself
trough development of excess pore water pressure even when subjected to pure shearing.
This is exactly what is depicted in the Figures 2.11 and 2.12.
Soft, normallyconsolidatedorlightlyoverconsolidatedclayshavethetendencytoreduce their
volume (contraction) when subjected to shear (deviatoric) stress in drained conditions. As
a consequence NC soil under undrained conditions experience increase in the pore water
pressure under shear. The pore pressure Δp  monotonically increases with the increase of
theaxialdeformation ε  andtheincreaseofthedeviatoricstress q (Figures2.11aand2.12a).
The effective stress path in p− q diagram (Fig. 2.12) shows that the mean effective stress
p(cid:48) is reduced during the loading stage and the undrained strength is smaller than the drained
strength.

complete reversal of the sign and negative excess pore water pressure at large strains, thus
having larger undrained than the drained strength (Figures 2.11b and 2.12b).
Hint
Undrained strength of normally consolidated soft clay can be smaller than the drained
strength due to the contractive nature of NC clays. On the other hand, the undrained
strength of overconsolidated clay can be larger than the drained strength due to the ten-
dency of OC clays to expand when subjected to drained shear.
Special care must be taken when selecting appropriate model of the soil. For example, Mohr-
Coulomb model can significantly overestimate the undrained shear strength c , especial for
the normally consolidated (NC) soil. This is illustrated in the Figure 2.13 where the effective
stress path in the CU triaxial test are compared to the theoretical path obtained by the MC
model.
Hint
In the undrained effective stress analysis using effective parameters the undrained shear
strength c  is a consequence of the model, not an input parameter.
In the case of the MC model the material behaves linear elastic until the MC yield criterion is

Δp(cid:48) is linearly proportional to the change of the volumetric strain Δε , i.e. Δp(cid:48) = K(cid:48)Δε . For
the undrained conditions of soil saturated with water, the change of the volumetric strain Δε 
is very small due to the fact that the water is almost incompressible, i.e. Δε  ≈0. This in turn
means that the change of the effective mean stress Δp(cid:48) will be approx. zero - the stress paths
for MC model of the triaxial CU test in p−q diagram rise vertically (see Fig. 2.13, blue line)1.

Asaforementioned(seeFigures2.11and2.12)thisdoesnotcorrespondtotherealitybecause

This means that the Mohr-Coulomb model in the analysis based on the effective stress and
strength parameters can overestimate the undrained shear strength (c ,MC > c ,re) of NC
soil with contractive tendency under shearing (Figure 2.13). Neglecting this fact can have
serious consequences on the structures founded on such soil, followed by the catastrophic
outcome (Nicoll Highway collapse, COI et al. [5]).

2.5 Nonlinear Analysis
2.5.1 General
TALPAaccountsfortheelements’variousphysicalnonlinearitiesthathavebeenoutlinedabove
when the nonlinear analysis mode is activated (SYST PROB NONL).
Solution of the nonlinear system is done iteratively. To this end, starting from the initial state
of the system (primary load case) the system displacements are varied until the correspond-
ing system reactions, together with the specified external loading, form a balanced state of
equilibrium (= convergence wihtin apredefined tolerance). Theiterative change ofthe system
deformationstateisessentiallybasedonasuccessivesolutionofmodifiedlinearproblems. For
this purpose, several procedures are available. They are described in subsequent sections.
If a numerically state of equilibrium cannot be achieved within the specified maximum number
of iterations, the solution is terminated and labeled non-convergent.
2-18 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|TALPA
2.5.2 Iteration procedures
The implemented methods are essentially based on a modified Newton-Raphson technique
adopting a constant system stiffness. To assure performance, the procedure is enriched by
so-called secant related acceleration strategies (Crisfield / BFGS) which rely on a smart im-
provement of the current standard iterative displacement update (stemming from the standard
modified Newton-Raphson) according to mathematical methods, that account for information
of preceding iteration steps. Doing this, the convergence process is generally accelerated
significantly.
The following procedures are available:
• Standard Modified Newton-Raphson with initial system stiffness
• Crisfield Acceleration Method
• BFGS Acceleration Method
Control of these methods is achieved via CTRL KITE.
Default-wise, an additional ’slack’ line-search is applied (cf. subsection 2.5.3).
Crisfield Acceleration Method
The CRISFIELD method is based on a modification of the standard iterative displacement up-
δ∗
date of the following form (2-vector-update):

δ  =F·δ∗  +E·δ −1 (2.16)
The scaling factor stemming from an optional line-search procedure is, for the sake of clarity,
not considered in this notation. Apparently, the new update is composed of the standard up-
date and the update from the previous iteration step. The influence of the previous update is
accounted for via the factor E. The calculation rules for the factors E and F are not reproduced
here–detailedinformationcanbefoundinChrisfield[9]andChrisfield[10]. Setting E=0 and
F=1 the formulation reduces to the standard update.
To improve robustness of the solution procedure, permissible ranges for E and F are defined
by additional control parameters FMN, FMAX and EMAX, please refer to CTRL KITE.
BFGS Acceleration Method
WhiletheCrisfieldmethodincorporatesadditionalinformation −1 fromtheprecedingiteration
step only, the BFGS (BROYDEN-FLETCHER-GOLDFARB-SHANNO) method uses information of
the preceding k iterations to establish an improved update δ  for the current iteration step.
For details of the method, please refer to Crisfield [11] and Luenberger [12].
2.5.3 Line-search
Theline-searchprocedureaimsatmodifyingthecurrentdisplacementincrement’ssteplength
insuchawaythattheenergypotentialisminimizedinthecurrentsearchdirectionδp . Hence,

theessentialgoalistofindanoptimumsteplengthinthecurrentsearchdirection. Tothisend,
a line-search factor η is introduced. The iterative update of the displacements can then be
SOFiSTiK2023 2-19TALPA|TheoreticalPrinciples
written as
  = −1+η·δ . (2.17)
In order to minimize the potential energy we require the scalar product of residual force vec-
tor and displacement increment vector (=energy) to vanish, or more practically, to satisfy a
specified tolerance. From this condition the line-search factor η can be determined.
The implementation of the adopted line-search procedure follows the lines given in Crisfield
[11].
The line-search can be very useful to control the solution process for problems that exhibit a
volatile nonlinear response.
Control of the line-search procedure is achieved via CTRL LSRC.

failure occurs, i.e. (numerical) equilibrium can no longer be achieved.

Startingfromastateofequilibrium(primaryloadcase),theprocedurethengraduallyincreases
the load level factor λ until its final value λ m (normally, λ m = 1.0) is reached. For every
processed load level, equilibrium iterations are performed.
Two flavors of stepping methods are available, the Constant Stepping Scheme and the Adap-
tive Stepping Scheme.
Control of the stepping scheme is achieved via CTRL STEP.
2-20 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|TALPA
Constant stepping scheme
The Constant stepping scheme applies a subdivision of the effective system load vector q
eƒ
into N integral increments of equal magnitude
Δλ=const.=λ m/N . (2.19)
Adaptive stepping scheme
For the adaptive stepping scheme, as a starting point, only the magnitude of the starting in-
crement Δλ 0 is specified. The magnitude of the subsequent increments Δλ n is determined
automatically.
Choiceof theincrementsize isbasedon theconvergence behaviour –a smoothconvergence
for the current load increment will result in an increase of the increment for the next load step
Δλ n+1 >Δλ n (2.20)
Problematic convergence on the other hand will cause the increment to be reduced
Δλ n+1 <Δλ n (2.21)
In case convergence is not achieved within the maximum number of iterations, a reduction of
the corresponding load increment’s magnitude and a restart of iterations is performed.
The load stepping procedure is terminated either in case of the maximum load level factor
λ m being reached, or in case of undershooting the specified minimum step length Δλ mn
after repeated increment reduction.
For details regarding step-length control and increment reduction, please refer to Chrisfield
[10].
Adaptive stepping scheme with arc-length control
For the adaptive stepping scheme with arc-length control, the residual force iterations for one
load step are not carried out at a prescribed constant load level. Instead, the load increment
Δλ is considered as an additional variable which is determined by imposing a complementary
condition
!
Δ=Δ(Δ)=const (2.22)
onto the system of equations (May and Duan [13] and Chrisfield [14]).
From the provided starting load level factor λ 0, the initial arc-length Δ 0 is automatically deter-
mined. For subsequent steps, Δ n+1 is then adapted automatically following the same lines
as for the load factor in the standard adaptive scheme, i.e., under account of the convergence
behavior of the current loading step n.
In case convergence is not achieved within the maximum number of iterations, a reduction of
the corresponding load increment’s magnitude and a restart of iterations is performed.
The load stepping procedure is terminated as soon as one of the following criteria is met:
• The specified maximum load level factor λ m is reached.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-21TALPA|TheoreticalPrinciples
• The specified maximum number of load steps is reached.
• Undershooting of the specified minimum step length Δλ mn after repeated load increment
reduction.
For further details regarding arc-length control, please refer to Chrisfield [14], May and Duan
[13] and Heidkamp [15].
2.5.5 Safety assessment by the phi-c reduction method
In the context of geotechnical engineering, system failure and/ or system stability is frequently
governed by the soil’s shear strength. This notion is reflected by the FELLENIUS rule which
defines safety as the ratio between actual shear strength and mobilized shear strength for the
system limit state (system state at failure)
tn(cid:0)φ (cid:1) c
np np
η φ = and η c = (2.23)
tn(φ ) c
mobzed mobzed
Adopting this concept, the task is to determine the mobilized shear strength – i.e., the shear
strength that is actually required to assure balance of a given loading state.
Tothisend,thealgorithmicframeworkoftheloadsteppingscheme,initiallyaimingatagradual
increase of the effective system load, is now used in order to simulate a gradual decrease of
the system’s resistance. To illustrate this, Equation 2.18 is rewritten as
g()≡(cid:2)F (,η)−F (cid:0)σ pc(cid:1)(cid:3)=! 0 (2.24)
In this notation, the material safety factor η has been introduced. Furthermore, it is assumed
thattheprocedureislaunchedfromabalancedsystemstate,whichmeansthatfortheeffective
system load F eƒ = 0 holds. Starting with η = 1.0, the algorithm decreases the system’s
resistance by increasing the material safety in a step-wise manner. Adopting a synchronized
increaseofthesafetyfactors η φ =η c =η,theeffectiveshearstrengthforstep n isdetermined
according to
tn(cid:0)φ (cid:1) c
np np
tn(φ n)= nd c n = (2.25)
η η
n n
If – as a result of the reduced strength parameters – local strength violations are induced
by the given loading state, stress redistribution takes place and the iterative procedure tries to
establishanewsystemdeformationstatethatbothconformswiththestrengthconditionsand
representsastateofequilibrium. Thisway,thesystemresistanceisgraduallyreduceduntilno
further stress redistribution is possible and a (numerical) failure mechanism has formed.
Similar to the standard load stepping algorithm, also the phi-c reduction scheme is extended
by an additional arc-length control. The arc-length control provides for an automatic adaption
of the safety level η n within one load step n. Doing this, the (most critical) system collapse
mechanism can be numerically tracked in a robust manner; thus, allowing for a significantly
improved identification of the stability limit. Just as for the standard arc-length procedure (cf.
subsection 2.5.4), the new arc-length Δ n+1 is continuously adapted depending on the actual
iteration performance.
2-22 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|TALPA
Stepping without arc-length control leaves the adopted safety level η n constant for each load
stepn;thus,theprocedureincrementallyapproachesthe(mostcritical)systemcollapsemech-
anism.
Similartotheloadstepping,cf. subsection2.5.4,theprocedureterminatesifoneofthefollow-
ing criteria is met:
• The specified maximum safety level η m is reached.
• The specified maximum number of load steps is reached.
• Undershooting of the specified minimum safety increment Δη mn after repeated load incre-
ment reduction.

Hint
Itshouldbenoted,thatthephi-creductiontechniquebynomeanscanreplaceengineer-
ing judgement. It can provide valuable additional information for safety assessment – the
assessment itself, however, remains the engineer’s very own task.
The phi-c reduction applies to all nonlinear soil material models incorporating a suitable
strength criterion, cf. AQUA: NMAT:
VMIS Strength criterion according to VON MISE
DRUC Strength criterion according to DRUCKER-PRAGER
MOHR Strength criterion according to MOHR-COULOMB

COULOMB
ROCK Base material with strength criterion according to MOHR-COULOMB, additional ori-
ented shear plane with limited shear strength
FAUL Oriented shear plane with limited shear strength
The particular hardening capabilities of advanced soil models (GRAN) are irrelevant for the
stabilityanalysis. Inthecontextofthephi-creduction,theformulationisthereforeautomatically
reduced to standard elastoplastic behavior with a MOHR-COULOMB failure criterion (MOHR).
Material properties of beam, spring, truss and cable elements are not affected by the phi-c
reduction.

3 Input Description
3.1 Input Language
Input is written in text using the free format of the CADINP input language (see the general
manual ’SOFiSTiK Basics’).
The static system must have been generated without any errors and it must have been stored
in the database.
The input is divided into blocks ending with the record END. Inside each block a particular
system or certain load cases (in case of non-linear analysis only one) can be analysed. The
program ends when it finds an empty block (END/END).
Three categories of units are distinguished:
mm Fixed unit. Input is always required in the specified unit.
[mm] Explicit unit. Input defaults to the specified unit. Alternatively, an explicit as-
signment of a related unit is possible (eg. 2.5[m] ).
[mm] Implicit unit. Implicit units are categorised semantically and denoted by a cor-
1011
responding identity number (shown in green). Valid categories referring to the
unit ”length” are, for example, geodetic elevation, section length and thickness.
Thedefaultunitforeachcategoryisdefinedbythecurrentlyactive(designcode
specific) unit set. This input default can be overridden as described above. The
specified unit in square brackets corresponds to the default for unit set 5 (Eu-
rocodes, NORM UNIT 5).

Crisfield Acceleration Method
The Crisfield Acceleration Method (cf. subsection 2.5.2) is selected by VAL=1. For nonlinear
calculations, this is the default. To improve robustness, the acceleration factors E and F are
restricted to permissible ranges. This is assured by means of the control parameters FMAX,
FMN and EMAX. Upper and lower bounds for F are defined, such that
FMN≤F≤FMAX (3.1)
SOFiSTiK2023 3-7TALPA|InputDescription
with the default values being
FMAX=3.5 and FMN=1/FMAX (3.2)
Additionally, the ratio E/F is controlled by the input parameter EMAX, such that
(cid:18)E(cid:19)
−EMAX≤ ≤EMAX (3.3)
F
By default, EMAX=0.3.
In case F exceeds the specified limits, instead of the acceleration the standard update (E = 0
and F = 1) is activated (cut-out criterion according to Chrisfield [20]). For the factor E, on the
other hand, no cut-out is performed – it is bounded to the specified range, only.
BFGS Acceleration Method
The BFGS Acceleration Method (cf. subsection 2.5.2) is selected by VAL ≥ 2. In this case,
VAL specifies the maximum number of vectors that are used to determine the improved dis-
placement update. The suggested range is 6≤VAL≤16.
Standard Modified Newton-Raphson
The Standard Modified Newton-Raphson approach is triggered by specifying VAL = 0. In this
case, the iterative displcacement update is purely based on the initial linear system stiffness.
3.5.3 LSRC Line-search
LSRC Description Unit Default
VAL tolerance, input of VAL=0 deactivates line-search − 0.7
FMAX maximum step width − 4.0
FMIN minimum step width − 0.1
EMAX maximum amplification factor − 2.0
Parameters of the line-search procedure (cf. subsection 2.5.3) are controlled via the CTRL
LSRC option.
By default, a ’slack’ line-search with a tolerance limit of VAL = 0.7 is applied for nonlinear
problems. For cases showing a pronounced nonlinear behavior, a more tightened tolerance is
possibly reasonable. The line search can be deactivated by specifying VAL = 0. Modification
of the remaining control parameters FMAX, FMN and EMAX is usually not required.
If the line-search is activated, the iteration protocol is complemented by printout of the line-
search factor ETA and the corresponding (energy-)NORM.

NO, the load case number is increased by 1 for every storage. SAVE 0 (default) stores results
of the final increment, only.

3.5.5 EPOL Extrapolation
In case of an incremental calculation (CTRL STEP) the iterative process can possibly be ac-

of computing them from the (linear) system stiffness. Often, this procedure yields apparently
improved starting values for the iteration process.

In a general way, the temperature dependent mechanical strength and stiffness evolution can
be described by means of a family of work laws and dedicated temperature strains - i.e., one
worklawforeachdefinedtemperaturelevel. Ifnocorrespondingexplicituserinputisprovided
(AQUA SSLA), the program adopts work laws and temperature strains according to EN 1992-
1-2:2004.
Hint

– the work laws are defined as being associated with the ultimate limit state – a cor-
responding selection via NSTR KSV UL(D) and KSV KSB UL(D), respectively, in the
corresponding TALPA runs is mandatory (cf. section 3.13).
Warning
The option EPST SHIFT is not allowed in this context.
Activating the option triggers evaluation of the material reaction based on the actual temper-
ature level of the material point under consideration. By default, concrete materials are sup-
posed to not exhibit re-hardening and re-stiffening effects due to cooling; they remain in the
damaged state corresponding to the maximum reached temperature in loading history. Steel
materials, on the contrary, are assumed to regain stiffness and strength during cooling. Nu-
merical evalulation is therefore based on the current temperature level (default setting). The
default settings regarding the cooling behavior can be changed via CTRL FIRE TCRL.
The option CTRL FIRE is effective for the fiber beam element, only. Provision of a tem-
perature profile is possible with constant and linear variation over the cross-section depth;
achieved simply by specifying corresponding standard beam temperature loads (BEAM TYPE
DT, BEAM TYPE DTZ), i.e. temperature increments. As of SP 2014-3, additionally, the input
and processing of general nonlinear temperature profiles is supported (absolute temperatures

temp-nonl.dat illustrate the mechanical behavior of concrete at high temperatures.
Hint
Generally, structural analysis under fire loading is based on the assumption of concrete
not carrying any tensile stresses. A temperature dependent reduction of the concrete
tensile strength is not performed by the program.

Hint
The choice of hyperelastic material behavior may be useful in case of a fire analysis
in order to simulate the stress relaxation as an effect of stiffness degradation at higher
temperatures. Doing this, the conservation of ’high’ constraint stresses originating from
primary loading with lower temperature, hence higher stiffness, can be avoided.
Apossiblepermanentmaterialdegradationduetotemperature(cf. section3.5.9)remains
unaffected by this choice.
This choice also takes effect for the (reinforcing) steel material behavior.

The fiber beam’s fracture energy based damage model for concrete is exclusively con-
trolled by the material parameters fracture energy and tensile strength. A possibly pro-

The automatic provision for steel-concrete bond behavior is based on a modification of the
steel strain, in accordance with the current state of cracking. Three phases are distinguished:
• Uncracked state (state I)
• Crack formation phase
• Stabilized cracking (state II)
For details of the adopted procedure, we refer to secondary literature (Comité Euro-
InternationalduBéton[21],sections3.2.3,7.4.3). Thesimulationexample uniaxial-tension.dat
nicely illustrates the mechanical ’stiffening’ effect of the steel-concrete bond behavior.
Redifinition of material properties is temporary (takes effect for the current analysis run, only;
no permanent storage of properties). If no specific material number is addressed, the input
applies to all concrete materials that are active in the current analysis run.

The GRAN model with extended option (cap model) is set as default since version 23.19. If

3.5.13 MSTE Material algorithm control
Most nonlinear material laws (cf.AQUA: NMAT) are formulated in rate form. With a given total
strain increment the corresponding stress increment therefore is generally established via in-
tegration of the nonlinear strain rates. For this procedure powerful and robust algorithms are
used–mostlyimplicitalgorithms(Backward-Euler),insomecasesexplicitones(Runge-Kutta,
Forward-Euler).
For the SOFiSTiK standard materials, control parameters of these algorithms are internally
preset and not subject to user input.

3.5.14 DEFO Storage of nodal displacements
Prior to storage in the database, the computed displacements of the current load step are
scaled by means of the factor provided here. This option is useful in the context of an in-situ
stress state computation by means of the K-procedure (gravity loading), which is a common
means for geomechanical analyses. In other situations, use of this option is discouraged. The
systemdeformationcomputedbytheK-procedureisofnopracticalrelevance,itisanumerical
result of generating the desired stress state, only. Specification of CTRL DEFO 0.0 effectively
sets the nodal displacements to zero. The option CTRL DEFO ’AUTO’ triggers an automatic
decision making procedure. In this case, the nodal displacements are set to zero, if all three
subsequent conditions are fulfilled for the respective load step:
• no primary load case is referenced
• the K-procedure is used
• equilibrium (convergence) is achieved

the intermediate steps are normally stored in the data base, as well - as separate load cases

ForsolvingtheequationsystemsoftheFinite-Elementproblem,SOFiSTiKprovidesanumber
of solvers. Which solver is used best depends highly on the type of the system and requires
knowledge of relevant system parameters. Following types are available:
• Direct Skyline Solver (Gauss/Cholesky)
This is the classical solver of the FE-Method. The current implementation works best on
a skyline oriented matrix. The storage needed depends on the internal optimization of the
node numbers and may become quite large for 3D structures.
• Iterative Solver (Conjugate Gradients)
One advantage of the iterative solver lies in its reduced requirements for storage, but it
may also provide reduced computing time compared to the previous two types especially
in case of large volume structures.
• Direct Sparse Solver
These types of solvers correspond to state of technology. A quite efficient version based
on the work of Davis [22] is available as well as a direct parallel solver PARDISO.
The advantage of the direct solvers is especially given in case of multiple right hand sides, as
theeffortforsolvingthemisverysmallcomparedtothetriangulizationoftheequationsystem.
Thus they are the first choice for any dynamic analysis or in case of many load cases.

The iterative (CTRL SOLV 2) and the parallel sparse solver (CTRL SOLV 4) can be run in par-

a license of type ”HISOLV”. More information about parallelization can be found in subsec-

considerable high amount of iterations and is therefore not recommended in most cases.
• Incomplete Cholesky (V4=1)
Thistypeofpreconditioningperformsapartialtriangulizationoftheinputmatrix. Compared
to a full triangulization with the Cholesky method, the Incomplete Cholesky saves time by
ignoring the so called Fill-In during decomposition.
• Incomplete Inverse (V4=2)
This type of preconditioning is generally inferior to the Cholesky method. This applies to
the convergence-rate as well as the time required for computing the inverses. It shows
however better performance in case of more densely populated matrices (Recommended
threshold V5: 0.01).
Foranykindofpreconditioningthenumberofmatrixentriestakenintoaccountduringprecon-

Hint

optimization in SOFiMSHA/C could also be deactivated using (CTRL OPTI 0) in order to save
memory during system generation. On the other hand however, this solver does not allow
reusing the factorized stiffness matrix in other programs. Thus, a usage in combination with
the program ELLA is not possible.

SOFiSTiK supports parallel computing for selected equation solvers. Additionally, some pro-

Activation of parallel computing
By default parallel computing is triggered automatically where it is feasible.
Parallel computing requires corresponding hardware and operation system support. In addi-
SOFiSTiK2023 3-21TALPA|InputDescription
tion, availability of an adequate SOFiSTiK license is obligatory.
Hint
Parallel computing requires availability of a HISOLV license (ISOL granule).
Number of available threads for parallel computing
If parallel computing is active, the number of adopted threads is determined as follows (listed
with increasing priority):
a) The software retrieves the information about the number of available physical processor
cores on the system. This number defines the default number of threads that are used
when a parallel computation is activated.
b) This default can be modified via the environment variable SOF_NUM_THREADS, which is
also available as sofistik.def parameter.
c) Finally, an explicit statement CTRL CORE NN (or as relative input CTRL CORE NN[%])
temporarily assigns the number of available threads for the respective run.
Hint
Neither option b) nor option c) state an explicit parallel computation request. The deci-
sionif a parallelcomputation istriggered, dependson theactual analysisoption (parallel
processing must be supported for the specific task) and the availability of an adequate
license. Parallel computing can be suppressed by explitly setting the number of available
threads to 1 (or 0).

Record PHRS facilitates a phreatic surface definition. According to their relative position re-
garding the specified phreatic level, the finite elements’ self-weight is then automatically com-
puted using either the "specific weight" or the "specific weight under buoyancy" (see AQUA
manual, command MAT/ MATE).
HW defines a horizontal phreatic surface by specification of the corresponding ordinate on the
gravity axis (analogous to HW option in record GRP).
Alternatively, via load case number LC and time T a hydraulic potential distribution may be
referenced, from which the program automatically computes position of the phreatic surface.
Using this option, curved phreatic surface shapes - which may arise, e.g., as a result from a
local ground water lowering - can be treated in a convenient and consistent manner.

Entering PLC in record SYST is equivalent to specifying TYPE FULL. Displacements of the
primary load case are added to the ones of the currently active load case if and only if PLC
has TYPE FULL or PLC has been provided in the record SYST.
Further you may select with LADD an additional load case, which contains eigenstresses or
eigen mode shapes, to be added to the primary state with a factor. Stresses above the yield
limit will then be reduced with a non-linear analysis. As there are no equivalent external load
patterns available in general, a calculation as activated primary load case is only reasonable
in special cases.

General remarks
TherecordGRPcontrolstheelementsthatarepartofthecalculationstep,e.gforsimulationof
construction stages. Additionally, a stress state that is present at the beginning of the analysis
(→ analytical primary stress state) can be specified here. The group specification is valid for
all load cases of the input block.
Each element is associated with an element group via its element number. The classification
can be done either with equally sized element groups using the group divisor GDIV or with
variable group sizes (please refer to SOFIMSHA: SYST).
In absence of any GRP specification, by default all elements are used. If GRP is specified,
however, only the referenced element groups are activated - all others are considered inactive
forthecomputationstep. Withinonecalculationrun(PROGTALPA)thedefaultgroupselection
is the one of the previous calculation step. In case of change of group control the element
stiffnesses are reassembled.
Standard group factors
FACD controls the group’s elements gravity loading for the current calculation step by fac-
torizing the self-weigth computed from the respective specific material weights (GAM/GAMA
specification, cf. AQUA: MAT).
FACS enables factorization of the group’s elements elastic stiffness for the current calculation
step.

Primary stress states
For the selected element group, PLC references the construction stage (load case number)

Ifanelementgroupisnotmeanttobebasedonaprimaryloadcase(e.g. installationofanew
element group), GRP ... PLC 0 or GRP ... PLC ’SITU’ must be specified.
The extended option PLC ’SITU’ is motivated by the special characteristics of the Hardening
Plasticity Soil Model (cf. AQUA: NMAT.GRAN). PLC ’SITU’ deactivates the hardening behav-
ior of the referenced elements for the respective load step; the material’s strength properties
remain unaffected, however. For the achieved (equilibrium) stress state, subsequently an au-
tomaticcalibrationofthematerial-internalhardeningparametersisconducted. Altogether,this
procedure therefore consistently captures the material state with respect to stress, strength
and hardening.
FACL controls the adoption of the internal forces and stress state from the referenced primary
state primary load case.
For further information on the concept of primary states, please refer to section 2.4.1.
Hint
For the special case of an (artificial) relaxation of element groups (frequently used in
tunneling simulations) a common calibration factor α is adopted for the group factors
such that

Ground water level
The parameter HW specifies the groundwater level for the corresponding group. Elements
whose center point is located below HW are subjected to buoyancy forces. This is accounted
for by applying the material’s specific weight under buoyancy GAMA (cf. AQUA: MAT).
Calculation of the analytical primary stress is accordingly based on the value GAMA specified
in the GRP input, cf. analytical primary state, section 2.4.1.
The default setting for HW is infinite depth.
2-phase model

lecting undrained (TYPE UNDR) or drained (TYPE DRAI) boundary conditions, the 2-phase
model with an explicit account of excess pore water pressures can be activated (cf. AQUA:
NMAT.UNDR).
Selecting undrained conditions (TYPE UNDR), the flowout of pore water is suppressed. This
option results in:
• A (significantly) increased material’s bulk stiffness due to the contribution of pore water.
• Apossiblegenerationand/orchangeofexcessporewaterpressurescausedbyvolumetric
deformation.
For drained conditions (TYPE DRAI), pore water flow is unrestrained. This means:
• No contribution of pore water to the material’s bulk stiffness.
• New excess pore water pressures cannot be generated and possibly existing excess pore
water pressures (from PLC) will vanish (FACU=0.0).
Hint
For the 2-phase approach to be active for a particular element, both the corresponding
undrainedmaterialproperties(AQUA:NMAT.UNDR)mustbeprovidedand TYPEUNDR/
DRAI must be specified. If this is not the case, the corresponding element is taken as
non-porous.
For the non-porous option (TYPE NONP), the material is assumed to behave independent
of pore water content. Consequently, possibly defined undrained material properties take no
effect,nodifferentiationbetweeneffectivestressesand(excess)porewaterpressuresismade.
Parameter FACU controls the initial excess pore water pressure state for the present loading
step. The initial state for the present loading step is established by factorizing excess pore
water pressures from the referenced primary load case by FACU. FACU defaults to:
3-30 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|TALPA
FACU=1.0 for TYPE UNDR.
FACU=0.0 for TYPE DRAI. Due to the unrestrained pore water flow, possibly existing
excess pore water pressures will completely vanish.
Hint
The2-phasematerialmodelissensitivetothevolumetricdeformationbehaviorofthesoil
skeleton. Therefore, special care is required regarding the choice of material model and
corresponding parameters. In particular, adoption of a standard elastoplastic model (e.g.
DRUC/MOHR)mayleadtoanoverestimationofthematerial’sundrainedshearstrength!
For a detailed elaboration, please refer to section 2.4.4.
Temperature distribution from HYDRA
With record TPLC a temperature field from the program HYDRA can be imported to calculate
the stresses for the temperature load. To achieve this, FACT 1.0 must be entered.
Varying material stiffness due to different hydratation degrees can be taken into account. The
reference of the hydration load case (calculation with HYDRA) is done via HPLC lc ALP0
alpha0, where alpha0 denotes the lower threshold for stiffness development.
Swelling of Soils
The number of primary load case for swelling PLQ and the factor for swelling FACQ allow the
explicit activation of the swelling process for individual groups with adequate material proper-
ties. PLQdefinestheprimaryloadcaseforswelling(NMATSWEL).Withregardtoswellingthis
loadcaseisinastateofequilibrium. Theinitialstateofthesoilbeforestartoftheconstruction
work usually satisfies this prerequisite. The influence of swelling effect can be scaled by the
factor FACQ. An input of FACQ not equal to 0.0 activates swelling (default 0.0).
Effect of hinges for beam elements
Possibly specified beam hinge effects during system generation can be deactivated element
group wise via HING. This takes effect both for explicit (=ordinary) and implicit (=work law
controlled) hinges.

General remarks
Record CS initiates a construction stage description. It only contains general descriptors that
relatetotheconstructionstageasawhole(cs-number,duration,labelling). Theactualspecifi-
cation of what happens during this construction phase results from subsequent CGRP, CLOA
and CGW specifications. Sequence of construction stages in the input specification corre-
sponds to the actual construction sequence. Therefore, construction stage description is lim-
ited to indication of changes with respect to the foregoing construction phase - e.g. removal of
an element group from the system -which reduces input effort significantly (→ CGRP, CLOA,
CGW).
Ifnoconstructionstagenumberisspecified,numberingisperformedautomatically. Withman-
ual assignment, assure that numbering is in ascending order. In case of illegal numbering the
program switches to automatic assignment.

3.21.1 Element results
The internal forces and stresses are printed for each QUAD element at the element center
(ECHO STRE YES). Additional output of the element reactions at the integration points is
obtained by requesting ECHO STRE FULL.
The internal forces for each beam element are printed at its beginning and at its end.
The displacements and the axial forces are printed for all spring and truss elements.
3.21.2 Averaged element results at nodes
Foreachnode,internalforcesorstressesofadjacentQUAD-elementsareaveragedandstored

Averaging of the internal forces occurs group-wise, accounting for the groups defined at sys-
tem generation. Subgroups are formed automatically at nodes at which the thickness of the
bordering elements or the material number do not correspond. Hence, two or more results at
one node may be generated even within one group.
3.21.3 Distributed support reactions

FULL additionally triggers printout of the boundary-associated nodal reactions.
3.21.4 Residual forces
For non-linear calculations, by default the maximum residual forces per iteration are provided
in as an iteration log. The iteration log is suppressed by specifying ECHO RESI NO.

3.21.6 Plot of cross-sectional stress distribution (Fiber Beams)
For the option CSIG, an optional selection set can be specified. Two possibilities exist:
• Direct selection of elements or an element sequence via the element ID’s. Example:
ECHO CSIG FROM 1 TO 10 INC 1 selects all elements with ID’s in the range of 1 to 10.
• Selection of elements via primary or secondary group affiliation. Example:
ECHO CSIG GRP ’A2’ selects all elements belonging to (secondary) group A2.
