1 Task Description
AQBisusedforstressanalysisanddesignofcrosssectionscreatedwithAQUA.Theenhanced
version AQBS allows the consideration of the special features of prestressed concrete and
composite structures (prestressing tendons, imposed secondary stresses, creep and shrink-
age). This manual is valid for both versions. The optional features which are operative only in
AQBS are identified.
The forces and the prestressing tendons can be defined directly or be imported from the
database for beam, truss or cable elements. A whole series of design tasks can be carried
out with the selected forces. These are:
1. Creep and shrinkage analysis (AQBS only)
AQBS can examine creep and shrinkage in up to 99 creep intervals. Different creep
characteristicscanbedefinedforeachmaterial,sothatsubsequentlyaddedcrosssection
parts can be considered too. The internal forces due to creep are stored in the database
and they are taken into account in later creep stages or stress determinations.
2. Determination of the maximum stresses in the cross section according to the theory of
elasticity.
AQB can perform stress checks of any thick-walled or thin-walled cross section, including
shear stresses and warping torsion in accordance with a great variety of codes for steel,
timber, or prestressed concrete. Different stress limits can be considered for different
materials in the same cross section.
3. Determination of the required reinforcement or internal safety factor for unreinforced, re-
inforced or prestressed concrete cross sections.
AQB can design reinforced or prestressed concrete cross sections with an optimised dis-
tribution of the reinforcement for axial force and biaxial bending. International codes can
be taken into consideration. A shear design can be carried out following the bending
design.
4. Determination of the maximum stresses and actual stiffnesses for the defined material
law.
AQBS determines stress and strain distributions based on the material behaviour. This
makes it possible to perform controls on crack width limits, reinforcement stress range,
foundation pressures, and elastic-plastic design analysis. Also effective stiffnesses can
be determined with that for a non-linear static calculation (plastic-plastic).
Computed stresses, reinforcement and stiffnesses can be stored back in the database, and
they can both be graphically represented or be addressed by other modules.
The functions for design and stiffness determination are also integrated into STAR2 in a sim-
plified form. For this reason, tasks (3) and (4) can be also carried out directly with STAR2.
This makes it possible to do a static design taking the material behaviour into account. When
this procedure is used, however, only one design mode is possible for the entire structure. If
columns and girders are to be designed with different parameters, one can make an iteration
using the modules STAR2 and AQB by means of the command procedure PS (see general
manual SOFiSTiK: ’FEA / STRUCTURAL Installation and Basics’).

number of functions only. These are:
- Generally only uniaxial bending but for circular sections along the main bending direction
(piles)
- Stress checks for all cross sections
- Elastic-plastic analyses (STRE E) for rectangular, circular sections and structural steel
shapes
- Uniaxial reinforced concrete design for rectangles and T-beams and for circular/annular
sections.

2 Theoretical Principles
2.1 External Forces and Cross Section
2.1.1 Coordinate System
Cross sections are described according to DIN 1080 in the local y-z coordinate system of
the beam. Here the x-axis points in the longitudinal direction of the bar. The observer is
looking at the positive boundary of the section (from the end of the bar to the beginning). For
the description of the forces and moments and the support conditions, three points along the
beam have to be distinguished within a section: Beam axis, elastic center and shear center.
For more details see the manual for AQUA.
S
M
Figure2.1: Coordinatesystem
2.1.2 External Forces and Moments
The external forces and moments are longitudinal or transverse forces referring to the elastic
centre and the shear centre of the construction stage section used in the analysis.
Theelasticcenteristhepointwhereanactingnormalforcewillcreateonlyacentricstrainand
thus no moments.
In special cases, one can select any other point in the cross section.
For design purposes, the internal forces and moments are normally modified as follows.
The longitudinal and transverse forces are converted to axial and shear forces. The torsional
moment is dismantled in a Saint-Venant part and a secondary part from warping torsion.
Within the defined support boundary, moments are smoothed under the assumption of a uni-
form surface pressure (parabolic). The smoothing is done for each side of the beam, and the
shear force at the end of the beam is set to zero.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-1AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
Ifthecrosssectionislocatedwithinahaunch,theshearstressdistributionwillchangeconsid-
erably, however the practical design rules will account for that by changing the shear force in
accordance with the following formula:
M
V∗ = V − · (tnα − tnαb) (2.1)
D
For D other values like the lever arm of the inner forces are possible. As the effect may be
favourable or unfavourable, it might be difficult to choose ”correct” values. However, the user
may limit the size of the inclinations. If the cross section is in a bend the mean values of the
inclinations are used.
If a representative shear section or a face has been defined for the beam, the shear forces in-
sidethesupportregionareassumedtobedecreasinglinearlytowardsthebeginningortheend
ofthebeam. Nocalculationwilltakeplaceofthepossiblyrequiredsuspensionreinforcement.

V = · V m (2.2)

The increase of the internal forces and moments of thin cross sections according to DIN 1045
17.2.1. (6) is carried out only for My and N and only for SREC and SCIR cross sections.
All options can be deactivated by the record CTRL.
2.1.3 Cross Sections
The static properties of a cross section are calculated by AQUA. The static properties of the
effective and total cross section are stored in the database for the static analysis.
Constructionmethodssuchasthoseofprestressedconcreteorcompositestructuresaredom-
inatedbythecreationofthecrosssectionintimestages. Theloadsoftheindividualloadcases
act upon different cross sections with varying location of the elastic centre.
AQUA allows therefore the definition of up to 9 construction stages which may have arbitrary
numbersofconstructionorprestressingstagesassigned. AQBitselfallowsfor30construction-
stagespercrosssection(e.g. gross,net,ideal). Eachloadcasecanbeassignedoneofthese
sections.
For stress analysis, the contributions of all cross section elements with the same material
number are combined into one common stress plane.
Differentstressdistributionsariseinthevariouspartsofthecrosssection,duetotheprogress
of construction or to creep and shrinkage. These are compiled into internal forces and mo-
ments and they are taken into consideration in stress analysis.
Through integration over the gross area partial internal forces and moments are compiled.
They are not in equilibrium but allow checks and facilitate the manual control of the stresses.
2-2 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
2.2 Stress Analysis by the Theory of Elasticity
2.2.1 Method of Stress Analysis
The normal stresses on the cross section under a given load are computed by the expanded
Swain formula.
N M  + M  M  + M  Mb
y z z yz z y y yz
σ  = + z − y −  (2.3)
A   − 2   − 2 CM
y z yz y z yz
The edge stresses (extreme values for bending about the principal axes) and the corner
stresses are evaluated separately.
The shear stresses are determined from the unit shear stresses calculated in AQUA. Using
thenormalandtheshearstressesandtakingintoconsiderationthelateralstressesσ y andσ z,
one can calculate the principal stresses and the von Mises stresses:
(cid:199)
σ  = 0.5(σ  + σ y) + 0.25(σ  − σ y)2 + τ2 (2.4)
(cid:199)
σ  = 0.5(σ  + σ y − 0.25(σ  − σ y)2 + τ2 (2.5)
(cid:114)
σ  = σ 2 + 3τ2 (2.6)
For an accurate check, one must analyze the entire cross section with its real geometry and
all particular points, because the location of the most adverse combination is not known a
priory, especially in case of general cross sections. AQB though examines the stresses at a
few selected points (shear sections, stress points and polygon points). The user should take
careofmeaningfulselections,butforaFEsectionallnodalpointsattheboundarywillbeused
in all cases, which should be sufficient im general. For rectangular sections, 21 points along
the height and the width will be checked.
2.2.2 Partial Cross Sections
For composite sections, construction stages and non effective or ideal sections some more
steps have to be done:
1. The given external forces and moments are transformed from the elastic centre (b) of the
analysis section to the centre of the ideal section (including reinforcements and tendons)
N de = N b (2.7)
M y de = M y b − N b · (z s de − z s b) (2.8)
M z de = M z b − N b · (y s de − y s b) (2.9)
SOFiSTiK2023 2-3AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
2. The strain level of the total cross section (Bernoulli hypothesis) derives from these inter-
nal forces and moments and the corresponding static moduli. The bending stresses are
developing with a reference to the centre of the effective section, because these stresses
must not create a residual normal force.
3. For any particular material, all components of the various loads and secondary eigen
stresses are scaled with the elasticity modulus and compiled, describing a planar strain
and stress distribution in the partial cross section.
4. With the presence of thermal eigen stresses, additional components will be calculated.
2.2.3 Limit Stresses
The computed stresses can be examined for limit values; a value exceeding the limit is iden-
tified in the printout with * after the stress. All standard values (e.g. in steel-, timber- or
prestressed concrete construction) can be invoked as limit stresses. The limit stresses are
checked separately for each material.
Depending on the declaration of the allowable stress type, additional specialities of the partic-
ular codes can be taken into consideration too:
• Checkoftheslendernessratioc/tforsteelplatesaccordingtothesectionclasses2or3of
EN 1993 or other design codes
• Reduction of the axial force components by EN 1995 / DIN 1052
Thecombinedcheckforaxialforceandbendingmomentiscarriedoutbyabendingstress
check where the axial force components are reduced, which is equivalent with a multipli-
cation of the utilisation equation in the design code with the allowable bending stress. In
analogmodethecheckofthetorsionoccursattheedgewithcorrespondinglyraisedshear
stresses from shear force.
• Differentiation between compression zone and pre-compressed tension zone.
• Reductionoftheprestresscomponentsinthepre-compressedcompressionzoneinaccor-
dance with DIN 4227 Sec. 15.3.
• Shear design under ultimate loads in accordance with Zone a, DIN 4227
• Check for the decompression limit state (e.g. according to EC 2, DIN 1045-1)
Hereitisverifiedthattheconcretecrosssectionhasonlycompressivestressattheedgeof
the precompressed tension zone due to prestress for the determinant action combination.
The decompression check is done with the input SPAN E STYP VH. The input STYP VH
sets here the permissible tensile stressesin the concrete to 0.00. The check is filled, if the
resistance factors are kept (≤ 1.0) → table: Maximum Degree of Utilization.
AQB determines the check edge from the centre of gravity of all tendons. In the case of
upper and lower tendons the check has to be done graphically.
The stresses which are determinant for the decompression check can be checked graphi-
callywiththeWINGinputBEAMTYPEDECOorinWinGRAFwithDesign → Stressofthe
material → Decompression stress.

2.3 Design of Sections
2.3.1 Section Classes
Most newer design codes for structural steel and composite structures are based on a elastic-
plastic or plastic-plastic design. To achieve this the sections are subdivided into four classes
as follows:
• Sections of class 1
are suitable for plastic hinges and a non-linear analysis with distributed yield areas (Analy-
sis option NSTR) and a detailed interaction of shear and normal stress.
• Sections of class 2
have limited deformation capacities. The analysis may be done according to linear theory

• Sections of class 4b
due to buckling of the plates, some parts of the section have to be treated as not effective
for normal stress, which has to be accounted for either during the definition of the section
or will be taken into account automatically within a nonlinear analysis.
The separation between the classes is rule by a width-to-thickness ratio c/t, defined in tables
ofthedesigncodes. Asthesectionclassisnotonlydependingonthestressesbutalsoonthe
material strength, it is of little use to specify a single class for a complete section, and such a
specification or evaluation of a section class in AQUA is not provided.
The design in AQB reverts the viewing direction of the design to the consistent way and has
considerable advantages for the checking and especially for the utilisation factors during plan-
ning. AQB does not check that all sections are in class X, but it computes that the utilisation
of the critical limit of c/t is less than the stress dependent required limit value. This allows also
to use slender elements within a plastic design or nonlinear analysis, if the stresses at these
elements are sufficiently small.
The check within AQB is done with the following possible variants:
• Design for stresses only, checking the c/t ratio according to sectional class 1+2+3+4a and
low utilisation of sections of class 4a (STRE E F)
• Design for stresses for section class 3, and if the section is classified in 1 or 2 a design for
sectional capacities with interactions according to Eurocode. (STRE C)
• Non linear design with hardening effects for sections of class 1 and 2. (NSTR)
• Designforstressesforsectionsofclass1-4withanonlinearanalysis,wherethenoneffec-
tive parts of the plates in class 4 are deactivated automatically.(NSTR)
For the design of sections of class 4 there are thus several possibilities:
• For small stresses load cases not relevant for stability may use increased c/t-limits (EN

sections may include yielding. EN 1993-1-1 describes in Chapter 6.2.1 (4) how to perform an
elastic stress check based on effective sectional values. But then we have several hints:
• Chapter 6.2.9.3 (1) requires only, that the stress should not exceed the yield stress.
• Chapter 6.2.9.3 (2) defines a simplified check based on the interaction with the elastic
sectional moduli W eƒƒ.
• Chapter6.2.2.4describeshowasectionwithawebinclass3maybeconvertedtoclass2
with the introduction of non effective areas.
As a nonlinear analysis including yield especially for the tensile parts but without hardening
does not exceed the yield stress, this method is within the requirements of the first bullet.
Chapter4.6onEN1993-1-5describesthesimplifiedcheckaccordingto6.2.9.3(2)asgeneral
rule, but it says also in chapter 4.2. (2): "‘Effective areas should be determined on the basis of
the linear strain distributions with the attainment of yield strain in the mid of the compression
plate."’
2.3.2 Utilisation Levels
For an effective design the ultimate bearing capacity is checked by utilisation levels of the
total forces. The interaction of the individual components is given on a simplified way in the
design codes and in general there are clauses to use modified schemes if appropriate. Very
often some parts of the section are reserved for a certain force component. An other severe
drawback is the non linearity of the interaction utilisation levels, i.e.
• the utilisation of a combined action may be lower than that of the largest component
• with half of the ultimate loading the utilisation value may be anything below 1.0, e.g. 0.25
or 0.75 for a quadratic expression
2-6 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
• Utilisations larger than 1.0 cannot be treated at all in many equations
AQB provides thus five types of interaction, the user may select. All interaction formulas try to
calculate a utilisation level which is as close as possible linear, i.e. giving an indication for the
possible load factor. For an utilisation level of 1.0 the expressions are equivalent.
• the utilisation of the yield stress by the elastic stresses (STRE E):
This is the square root of the yield criterion of all effects according EN 1993-1-1 6.2.1 (5),
Eq.6.1.
• the summation of all individual utilisation levels (STRE B):
This is equivalent to EN 1993-1-1 6.2.1 (7), Eq.6.2, however the contributions of trans-
verse shear and torsion will be added separately and not included in the utilisation of the
moments.
• the interaction according the consecutive equations of the Eurocode (STRE C):
The shear force will be included in the utilisation of the moments, but the axial force and
the torsion will be added separately.
• an evaluation of a plastic interaction (NSTR KSV PLD):
This method is not yet suitable for an iteration, but will only provide one point on the inter-
action surface.
• a non linear analysis (NSTR KSV ULD):
Thismethod doesnot onlyinclude finitestrains anda flowrule, butaccounts alsofor hard-
ening effects, which is allowed according EN 1993-1-5 Appendix C.6.
Some Remarks for the applied linearisation:
• Torsion is treated in EN 1993-1-1 6.2.7 in a very simplified way and not useable for cranes
for example. Thus the given reductions of the shear bearing capacity of equations 6.25
to 6.28 are not generally applicable. While a plastic deformation will reduce the effects of
warping torsion, this is not accounted for in the utilisation. For a nonlinear analysis, there
will be no iteration for equilibrium, but the warping deformation is accounted for in the flow
rule. Primary and secondary torsion as well as the warping moments will be added either
linearly or for the interaction with the sum of squares by their three contributions:

The reduction of the normal force is obtained from the remaining available sectional area.
As the provision of EN 1993-1-1 in equation 6.38 for the web areas is not applicable in
general, does not match the equation 6.18 (3) and the transverse shear of columns is of
minor importance, we use always the equation 6.18.

According to DIN 18800 (755) and OEN 4300 it is required to limit the plastic moments to
the 1.25-time value of the elastic limiting moments. This will be accounted for automatically
if these design codes have been selected. If the user does not want to become this effective
(continuousbeamwithconstantsection,withoutbucklingorsecondordertheory)hemayeither
choose a different design code or by assigning the buckling curve 0 to those sections.
The utilisation of the sectional class is obtained in AQB as follows: For very low stresses, the
extended limit value for section class 4 is applicable, which is quite large, thus the utilisation
levelislow. Withincreasingstressesthelimitvaluebecomessmallerandwhentheyieldstress
is reached, the limit is on the value for section class 3 (blue line in Fig. 2.2). Beyond that the
geometric utilisation ratios are applicable, i.e. the utilisation ratio for section class 3 will raise
with a jump to a value above 1.0 (Fig. 2.3). Then NSTR has to be used analyze a section with
non effective parts.

2.3.3 Buckling Limit
The case of buckling will occur if an element will suffer from large forces due to small defor-
mations induced by geometric non-linear effects. This will limit the ultimate load for slender
structures.
Thedesignforstabilitycanbedoneineitheroftwoways. Themostcommonchecksaredone
based on a single representative beam. The problem which persists is the determination of
the buckling length. The other way is to perform a global analysis using second order theory
and suitable imperfections. This is the general target of SOFiSTiK-Software. However there
are two exceptions to this general concept:
The design for axially compressed beams in accordance with DIN 18800 Part 2 / EN 1993
is also included under the stress design in AQB, since it is normally used for lateral buckling
perpendicular to the plane of the structure and for single truss braces. This requires however
the explicit definition of the buckling length coefficient.
The design is performed by means of a degree of utilization of the buckling load.

The design for the lateral torsional buckling is only possible based on a representative beam
and is performed by a separate software module BDK.
2.3.4 Special Treatment of EN 1999
For Aluminum all reductions due to heat affected zones (HAZ) according to table 3.2b/c have
to be defined by separate material numbers. A check on the c/t ratio resp. the reduction of the
effective thickness to account for local buckling according to paragraph 6.1.5. is implemented.
EurocodeEN1999usesinchapter6.2.1aunifieddesigncheckbasedonadmissiblestresses
andanationaldependentcombinationconstantC,increasingtheadmissibleyieldstress. This
is comparable to a sectional check for sections of class 3 or 4 ( α = 1.0). The shape factor α,
which is described with great details can be accounted for to a great extend with the plastic
design forces in AQUA.
2.4 Secondary Stresses (Creep and Construction Stages)
Secondary stresses may be induced by variant causes. The resultant of those stresses are
always zero for the total section. Possible causes are.
• Shrinkage
• Creep
• Relaxation of tendons
• non-uniform temperature
• induced stresses from construction stages
Alleffectshavetobedealedasafirststepatthesectionitself,whichisstillacomplextask. The
values needed are the acting stresses, the age of the concrete, the humidity, the temperature,
the class of cement etc. etc. Results are strains and stresses for the section.

If the characteristic of the development of stresses in time is known, it is possible to enhance
the precision of this explicit integration scheme by the introduction of a relaxation coefficients.

For very simple cases of single sections it might be sufficient to reduce the acting force by the
same factor which is given by the loss of prestress.
The results are stores as load cases. Analyses can therefore be carried out with up to 999
intervals.
There are some design code variants implemented. The selection is in general by the defined
material. The most important general solutions are selectable explicitly via CTRL EIGE. To

The influence of the temperature has to be distinguished between a thermal treating before
the current creep step or a temperature during the creep process. For the first case it is only
the effective age at the beginning of a creep step, in the second case creep and shrinkage
coefficients ant the time function will also change. For the latter case formulas are given in the
ModelCode2010. Inallothercases,theeffectiveageiscalculatedincludingthetemperature,

2.4.1 Shrinkage
Shrinkage is the decrease in volume of concrete caused by the drying process. Without rein-
forcement and outer constraints the stresses induced are caused from the different speed on
the outside and interior of thick constructions. Reinforcement will hamper the deformation and
thus create additional tensile stresses. More reinforcement will create more stress.
With introduction of the Eurocode/CEB 2010 the shrinkage is now divided in a drying contrac-
tion and a shrinkage effect. AQB uses four MEXT values (see chapter before) β c1,β c2 and
β cd1,β cd2 as follows:
ϵ cs(t)=ϵ c(t)+ϵ cd(t,t s) (2.22a)

While the creep effects start with the loading, the shrinkage will start from the beginning and
the drying with the end of the curing. The characteristic thickness is defined in AQUA either
explicitly or via the expression 2A/U. The factor 0.85 has been defined only for the Eurocode,
not with the MC 2010. The Eurocode defines also that there is no drying if the humidity is 100
%.
The value of the total shrinkage is given in tables or maps in the respective design codes (e.g.
DIN 4227 Table 7 for the matrix of dry / wet against thick / thin). Some provide also time
dependentcoefficients(e.g. Pict. 3inDIN4227),butveryoftenthetimefunctionforcreepand
shrinkage is assumed to be equal.

Thedefinitionofϕisalwaysrelatedtothevalueoftheelasticitymodulus. Whilemostanalyses
refer to the standard secant modulus (e.g. DIN 4227 Table 6), EN 1992 and DIN 1045-1 refer
to the tangent value after 28 days. AQB will factorize therefore the creep coefficients to match
the given Eb reference.
Forconcretethecreepcoefficientisalwaysforcompressivestresses. Thereislittleinformation
about the behaviour for tensile stresses. AQB will reduce the creep coefficient depending on
the tensile stress at the centre of the partial section. This may be deactivated with a CTRL
EIGE definition.

If a particular load acts in the first interval, the effects up to the end of the interval are calcu-
lated in terms of a plastic yield part and an elastic time-delayed part (curves 1 and 2). While
the plastic part is transferred unchanged to all subsequent creep stages, the delayed elastic
portion gets rebuilt. The currently operative total load acts then in the second interval with the
appropriate new creep coefficients.
All coefficients are automatically determined form the given environment conditions and time
and effective thickness . The plastic yield may be also specified by the user explicitly. The

For the summation approach the superposition is valid. Thus you may freely select between:
• To follow each loading until the end of times.
• To load and unload the structure for ever time step.
For the product approach the consideration of different phases is only possible by calculating
increments of stresses. This leads to a similar formula but with much larger values for the

2.4.3 Relaxation of Tendons
Relaxationoftendonsisimplementedwithaproductapproach. Thefirstfactorisgivendepen-
dant from the steel stress based on a time value of 1000 hours. This is a material property
defined in AQUA. AQB will account for the effective initial stress value of the tendon by an
iteration.
No effects for stress values less than 0.55 fpk will be assumed.
The second factor is then derived from the time. The user may specify this factor explicitly or
evaluate according to two variants:
• CEB 1990 Table 2.3.1 resp. EN 1992 3.3.2 / App. D
• EC2 Version 1992 Table 4.5
AsEN1992hasnowthesamevaluesastheCEBmodelcode,thesecondvariantwillbeonly
applied for explicit EC-Materials and a design code release year < 2000. The french BPEL 91
provides in Appendix 2 a rather complex formula for the direct evaluation of the relaxation loss
dependant on the 0.70 fpk-value, the stress and the time.

2.4.4 Numerical Treatment
The change in stresses due to creep and shrinkage, according to the formulation by Trost with
relaxation coefficient ρ (=0.80) is:
Δσ z = E z · Δε − σ Re (2.29)
E ϕ·σ −ε ·E

Δσ b = · Δε − (2.30)

Under the assumption of plane cross section, a bilinear deformation variation is assumed for
the strains resulting from creep and shrinkage:
Δε = Δε 0 +y ·Δε y + z·Δε z (2.31)
The magnitude of the strains derives from the condition that the sum of the axial forces and
moments of the all cross section elements must be zero in statically determinate structures.
Thesystemofequationswiththreeunknownsissolved,yieldingthesecondaryinternalforces
and moments of the individual partial cross sections.
Results of this check are the secondary stresses of all tendons and all cross section parts,
which are stored in the database and taken into account in subsequent stress or internal force
calculations for statically indeterminate structures. These secondary stresses are not saved
as normal internal forces and moments, since in composite cross sections there are values
present for each material, which cannot be addressed as such. The total resulting secondary
stresses are also calculated; these are zero for regular composite cross sections. For pre-
stressed concrete sections, however, there is a resulting value which is added in the printout
of the internal forces and moments and in all calculations under cracked condition. The sec-
ondary stresses for each material are considered separately in calculations under uncracked
condition. The sum of the secondary stresses is then no longer included in the determination
of the stresses.
In simple cases of analysis of one section only, one can create directly, using the input CTRL
EIGE 4, a record of statically indeterminate forces and moments which are calculated with the
same proportion as the statically determinate components.

several creep stages are usually needed for obtaining correct results. One must also make
certain that there are enough segments within the beam.
The same method can be used, for instance, to consider secondary stress states resulting
from the completion of a cross section, or from secondary temperature stresses.
2.4.5 Considering secondary stresses in non linear analysis
As secondary stresses are in equilibrium they have small effects on the ultimate bearing ca-
pacity, but they may have a significant effect for nonlinear analysis as performed with NSTR.
While the most general approach would be to follow the load history for every individual fibre,
which is done for a general hot analysis, AQB provides a faster approximation based on a
SOFiSTiK2023 2-15AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
linear stress distribution converted to secondary strains. The total stress is then given by the
stress-strain-law and a superposition of an incremental strain plane to the secondary strains:
(cid:129) σ secondry(cid:139)
σ  = σ Work ε 0 + y · ε y + z · ε z + (2.32)
E
Whereσ secondry mayalsoincludestressesfromtemperatureandearlierconstructionstages.
It is assumed, that the secondary stresses have no saftey factors assigned, thus if a nonlinear
analysis is introducing safety factors the strains have to increase, and redistribution of the
stresses are likely to occur.
Another problem occurs if the reinforcements included in the creep and shrinkage will change
laterduringthefollowingdesignprocess. Thestressesarethennolongerinequilibriumwhich
could lead to unreasonable results. AQB applies therefor a scaling of the secondary stress
of the reinforcements, but it is strongly recommended to redo the creep analysis with the final
reinforcement distribution to get reliable results.
2.5 Design of Reinforced Concrete
Thecalculationofnon-linearstressstatesisaprerequisiteforallfurthercheckswhichconsider
material properties. Compared to the more general case of the next chapter, we have for the
design only a limited range of allowed strain distributions, but on the other side an unknown
reinforcement grade. Thus calculating the reinforcement distribution is a considerably compli-
cated task, because additional empirical rules of the various regulations have to be observed.
Material properties must be differentiated according to whether they are to be as close to
reality as possible (e.g. for dynamic or deformation analyses), or are to be used with a safety
coefficient for calculating an ultimate strength.
Whereas the safety coefficients were formerly assigned more-or-less at random, sometimes
to the load and sometimes to the material, more recent regulations (Eurocode) provide for a
clearer separation between the safety coefficients for the loading and those for the material.
Since the safety coefficients of the material still depend on the nature of the loading or the
type of design, the values are specified in AQB explicitly. Definitions from AQUA may become
effective additionally.
Ifthecapacityofasectiondoesnotmatchtheactingforces,allforcesandmomentsarescaled
linearlywitharelativebearingcapacity. Thisisalsoperformedforlongitudinalforcesinatruss
model,butnotforpre-orposttensioning. Howevertherearecaseswhereacompressiveforce
may be favourable or unfavourable for a reinforced concrete section and the relative moment
capacity is required for a fixed normal force or similar. However it should be noted, that for
these cases it is not always possible to get a convergent solution. These cases are thus to be
defined with CTRL PIIA.
Prestressing can be generally considered in two methods. Either one eliminates from the ex-
ternal forcesand moments thestatically determinate partsof the prestress andthe secondary
stresses, and specifies the prestressing steel with an appropriate initial strain, or one allows
theactionofthetotalinternalforcesandmomentsandobservesthestressincreaseonly. Both
methods are completely equivalent. AQBS uses the first method for ultimate design, and the
second method for strain checks.
2-16 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
The prestressing of the tendons is used with their values after creep and shrinkage taking into
consideration the decompression due to the internal forces and moments on the reduced net
cross section. The initial strain is determined by the actual values of the internal forces and
moments, and then multiplied as a whole by the prestress factor.
2.6 Determination of the Required Reinforcement
2.6.1 Longitudinal Reinforcement
The reinforcement in AQUA has been arranged in layers. The reinforcement of a layer is
considered as tension reinforcement if the centre of the total reinforcement lies on the tension
side relative to the centroid of the cross section. A reinforcement with its centre on the other
sideisregardedascompressionreinforcement. Themeaningsofthelayertypesareasfollows:
M Minimum reinforcement
If the minimum reinforcement should be allways applied and not be increased, the maxi-
mumreinforcementmustbesetequaltotheminimumreinforcement. Ifthemaximumvalue
is larger than the minimum value, the user may select for the design if the layer is always
inserted with at least the defined magnitude for beams. Compressive members will al-
waysactivatetheminimumvalue,buttheminimumreinforcementinthecompressionzone
however is applied only when a corresponding tension reinforcement is also present.
Z Supplementary reinforcement
Layers of this type are optional. The layers are equivalent in ranking; the number serves
only for identification. The value of the reinforcement area is only to specify the reinforce-
ment ratio between the individual positions, and it is not a specification of minimum rein-
forcement. If supplementary reinforcements are not permitted to exceed a certain value,
an appropriate maximum value must be input.
S Sequential layers
This type of layer serves to control the sequential filling of the reinforcement layers known
from older programs. When a maximum value is reached, the next higher layer number is
addressed. The reinforcement of layer 0 can be defined as minimum reinforcement with
layer type M; all other layers must be of type S and have no minimum reinforcement.
Reinforcement with the same layer number is always increased by the same factor. The maxi-
mumfactorisgivenbythefirstelementreachingthemaximumreinforcementinthelayer. The
minimum factor is 0.0 for layers (S,Z) and 1.0 for active minimum reinforcement layers (M).
Maximum values may be ignored in the determination of the minimum reinforcement of the
statically required cross section.
Adesignmustfind,byiteration,astrainestateandareinforcementdistributionbywhichexter-
nal and internal forces match. Additional requirements for ductility trigger either safety factors
depending on the tensile steel strain or establish limits for the height of the compressive zone.
Iftheheightofthecompressivezoneexceedsthespecifiedlimits,compressivereinforcements
are required. But they should not be taken larger than the tensile reinforcements.
The class of possible strain states is further limited in such a way that only the ultimate limit
strain states are used. This reduces the number of unknowns in the strain plane to two. How-
ever, as additionally unknown factors of the reinforcement distribution are also present, there
might be more unknowns than conditions for the solution.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-17AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
For this reason, problems with more than one reinforcement layers do not always have
oneunambiguoussolution. Evenwithallthepossibleadditionalconditions(3),onecan
find a unique solution for a maximum of 4 to 6 layers, depending on the strain range.
Theprocedurerunsintwosteps. ThelimitstrainstateisiteratedintheouterloopbytheBFGS
method, similarly to what was described in the previous section.
• As a rule, a first attempt to achieve equilibrium is made with a strain variation between the
optimum tensile strain S1 to the maximum compressive strain C1 and a variation of the
reinforcement distribution. If this is successful while the limiting conditions are maintained,
anoptimumductilesolutionhasbeenfound,wherethelimitsontheheightofthecompres-
sive zone (x/d) are fulfilled. If this does not happen, the further procedure is determined
depending on the axial force.
• Incaseofcompressiveloading,thestrainonthetensionsideisreducedtothepointwhere
equilibrium is reached with a symmetric reinforcement distribution. The compressive zone
must be enclosed with shear links.
• In case of tensile loading, the following strain variations are successively used in search of
equilibrium:
a) Centric strain S2 per thousand
b) Compressive strain between 0 and C1
Tensile strain between S1 and S2
c) Fully tensioned cross section with variable tensile strain

• Compression reinforcement is inserted by a magnitude not greater than the tension rein-
forcement. ThisrequirementoftheoldDINisgeneralisedbymakingcertainthatthecentre
of the total reinforcement is located on the tensional side of the cross section relative to its
centre.
• Provided that a minimum reinforcement is defined in the data base from former design,
this in this respect partial one is considered than there is not any violation of the former
paragraph.
Evenwiththeselimitingconditions,theproblemcanstillbeambiguous. If,forinstance,several
layers could function as tension reinforcement, the distribution of the reinforcement would be
based on the defined base values of the steel areas. Since this is generally not desired,
the program uses additionally the distance of the reinforcement from the neutral axis and the
moment of inertia with respect to the neutral axis. A supplementary condition is formulated
for that purpose, which prefers reinforcement which is located farther outwards. If two layers
are at the same distance, they are treated in the same manner. If the distance of a layer is
zero,itisgivennoconsiderationwhatsoever. Interpolationisusedbetweenthesetwoextreme
situations. Thus, a layer which is half as far out as another can only increase up to about one
half the value of the outer layer.
Ifthecentreofsomelayerisattheouterextreme,onlythedistanceofthecentreisconsidered;
((cid:112)/A)
if all of the layers have zero centre distances, only the radii of inertia are considered.
This condition too is interpolated linearly between the extreme values. Furthermore, the far-
2-18 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
ther outward the reinforcement is positioned in the cross section, the more stringent the entire
conditionisformulated. Thissupplementaryconditiondoesnotaffecttheareaofthereinforce-
ment, but rather the factors of increase. Therefore, any change in the AS-values defined in
AQUA will have a certain influence on the reinforcement distribution.
The procedure of activating the layer numbers in sequence, which was customary in older
programs, can not handle changing loads. In special cases, such as multilayer peripheral
reinforcement or additional densifications, this method can be applied by defining sequential
layer numbers in AQUA.
Insuchcase,eachlayerisconsideredindividually. Layeriislaidonlyafterlayeri-1hasreached
itsmaximumvalue. Ifalayerisnotneeded(e.g. compressionreinforcement),itcanbepassed
over.
Beside the information from the cross section program on the distribution of reinforcement,
there are other parameters, especially the minimum reinforcement ratios, which are controlled
with the record DESI.
Theprogramdifferentiatesbetweenbendingandcompressionmembers. Thelimitisseteither
by the orientation within the global gravity direction or by a particular value of the relative load
eccentricity e/d (e.g. 3.5) or by explicit input.
One constructional reinforcement value can be prescribed for each type. This is an important
option in stability studies. The minimum reinforcement of the statically required cross section
can also be considered for compression members.
Theseminimumreinforcementvaluesholdequallyforallcrosssectionsofananalysisrunand
they are input as percentages of the cross sectional area.
The new reinforcement is the greatest of:
- reinforcement required by the current design
- minimum constructional reinforcement
- minimum reinforcement of the statically required section
- minimum reinforcement defined in the cross section program
- minimum reinforcement that has already been stored
The so computed reinforcement is used in subsequent checks.
2.6.2 Min. Reinforcement of the Statically Required Cross Section
Theminimumreinforcementofthestaticallyrequiredcrosssectionisapplicabletocompression
members. AQB recognises a compression member either by an explicit specification through
therecordBEAMorbytheorientationrelativetothegravitydirectionor,dependingontheload
case, by a relative eccentricity e/d < 3.5 and the limit axial force NLIM (record CTRL).
The minimum reinforcement according to DIN is computed by the method of first determining
the internal forces and moments that can be sustained by the cross section with an appropri-
ate reinforcement (e.g. 0.8 percent), and then reducing the reinforcement in proportion to its
relative strength.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-19AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
The minimum reinforcement for compression members according to EN 1992, on the other
hand, is accounted as follows (distinct values are defined in the national annexes):
As mn = mn(0.10·N/β s,0.002·A c) (2.33)
As minimum reinforcement is used the one layer, in case there is only one, or the minimum
reinforcementlayer,incasetherearemany,orthesupplementsincasesofcrosssectionswith
supplements only. Any entered maximum values of layers are ignored in this case. If multiple
layers are involved, the criteria of the previous section for the selection of the layers are used.
Outer reinforcement is thus given preference.
When the relative strength has been obtained, each layer is reduced by the same isotropic
factor. If the minimum reinforcement were attained exclusively by means of a layer laying on
one side only, at reduction by this method the minimum reinforcement ratio is not reached
under circumstances. An alternative method which admits priority to the absolute steel area
can lead to serious underdesign and is therefore unavailable.
Clearly comprehensible results are obtained when only one layer with minimum reinforcement
=maximumreinforcementisdefined, withusabledistributionandrelativelysmalltotalquantity
of steel, and all supplements lie on separate layers. The program changes then the minimum
reinforcement onto the necessary value.
2.6.3 Longitudinal reinforcments from transverse and torsional shear
The truss analogy of the shear design requires a tensile force in the longitudinal direction!
An optimal solution would introduce this force just from the beginning in the bending design,
astheaccountingofthecompressiveforcesafterwardisratherdifficult. Thisdesignmethodis
given in the Eurocode for the case of the transverse shear and may be selected in AQB with
input CTRL VM.
A drawback however is that the inclination of the struts has to be selected in advance or by
iteration and that point loads may lead to excessive values of the reinforcements if the shear
force changes the sign.
But as there is no need to design for more reinforcements than required at the location of the
maximum moment, it is quite common for best practice to use a shift rule with an offset for
the required reinforcements. Then we get additional reinforcements on both sides for a zero
moment which is a clear hint, that the longitudinal force is to be applied on the total section.
Forthetorsionalproblemthestandardworkflowistoevaluatetheutilisationoftheprovidedtotal
reinforcment for bending and to add the required torsional reinforcements. The true amount
is only known if the inclination of the truss model has been selected. A required longitudinal
reinforcement of 50 mm² for an inclination of 45° will yield for a cot of 1.75 thus a required
longitudinal reinforcement of 875 mm² for Torsion. If then an existing reinforcement of 1000
mm² has a relative capacity of 2.5, the required reinforcement will be 1000/2.5 + 875 = 1275
mm². This reinforcement may be adopted to compressive forces within the section, which is
not an easy task, but AQB will try to do so.
2-20 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
As in many cases the torsional design uses an inclination of 45°, it is easier and much more
economique,sometimesforexistingstructurepossiblytheonlysolutiontogowithanadditional
tensile force to the design similar to the transverse shear design.
ThedefaultistousethetensileforceapproachonlyfornonlinearanalysiswithNSTR,whilefor
any design with DESI the classical approach is selected. But according to the remarks above,
we suggest to use CTRL VM - 1.0 in general.
2.6.4 Structured Sections
DIN 1045-1 contains in 10.2. (6) a regulation limiting the strain in the centre of plates of
structuredsectionstothevalueof ε c2. ThiswillbeaccountedforinAQBatallcentrepointsof
shear cuts having the type FLAN. The default is to correct the maximum compressive strain.
If this is not what you want to do, then an explicit definition of the DESI C2 will deactivate this
behaviour. Then there are two possibilities:
• If nothing else is defined AQB will just check the strain and print an error message if its
value exceeds the limit of the stress-strain-law.
• For critical cases, if the last sentence of this paragraph is needed, which imposes the pure
web with the total maximum strains as an lower limit to the ultimate load, one has either to
deactivate the plates via the CS-mechanism or define them with a special material without
the rectangular block in the stress-strain-law.

• For DESI an additional row will be printed with the relative bearing capacity based on the
moments of the life load (Action L) with identifier (rel-tra(M-live))
SOFiSTiK2023 2-21AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
2.7 Shear Design
To account for the shear forces there are multiple methods available.
• AQUA will calculate the complete elastic shear stress by default with the Finite Element
method (see CTRL STYP). This is used for all elastic stress checks, but it can be taken as
afallbackorlowerlimitfortheothermethodsifthevaluesarereducedbyafactorobtained
from the internal lever in cracked condition to the uncracked condition.
• The method of differences of longitudinal forces is mainly used for flanges and bond in
composite sections (dowels)
• Thevariableanglestrutmodelisusedforcrackedconditions. Itisthebaseformostdesign
codes for uniaxial shear.
The shear design for ultimate limit states is always defined as the resultant magnitude of the
shear stress along the width b0. Thus we consider a shear flow T in [kN/m]. The torsional
shear based on an equivalent hollow section M t/2A k may be added then easily. As a shear or
principal compressive stress is valuable for the engineer we use and show these values too.
The utilisation ratio for a total design force is not useful in general cases.
No reduction is made of individual loads in proximity to the support. A consistent solution is
extremelyelaborate. Thus,onlythereductioncausedbythedistributedpressureofthesupport
is accounted for.
2.7.1 Difference of the Longitudinal Forces
The basic idea for shear is the equilibrium betweem the change of the normal stress and the
change of the shear stress.

This more general approach is also applicable for the design of the web including haunches,
butithassomeproblemswithtendonsleavingtheseparatedpartsbetweentwocrosssections
and loading in the longitudinal direction.
The bond shear can be also calculate assuming a rigid bond directly from the shear force for
every single beam section, But it will be obtained for a flexible bond only from the difference of
the longitudinal force components between two beam sections. Thus integral shear flow can
be calculated by different algorithms:

For a thin walled section, analyzed by the deformation method, the shear force in every
individual element is obtained with it’s exact value based on the transverse shear at a
single beam section. The element has a thickness controlling the flexibility of the bond-
Thus it should have a reasonable large value. However effects of creep and shrinkage are
not accounted for.
CUT Solution with a shear cut
The equivalent to the WELD for solid sections is a cut, where the shear stresses are in-
tegrated to the total bond force. The bond is inherently rigid, for elastic bond a finite layer
withareducedstiffnesshastobeinserted. Howevereffectsofcreepandshrinkagearenot
accounted for.
V*S/I Solution with the sectional modulus of partial area
This method has some similar concepts to the above two methods. The change of the
normal stress is obtained by the change of the moments multiplied with the resistances
for the bending stresses. But as a static determined method it will not work on multiple
connected sections. If the section does not contain cuts or weldings, AQB will calculate
thesevaluesforeverymaterial. Iftherearemorethantwomaterialsspecialconsiderations
apply.
ΔN/Δ Solution with Differences of the normal forces between two beam sections
A simple analysis is taking the difference between the maximum possible normal force
component at the mid span and the zero value at the zero-moment-location or the support
and is dividing this be the half of the span. Distributing this value evenly is switching to a
flexible bond implicitly. Changes of the longitudinal stress due to creep and shrinkage has
an immediate effect, but accounting for inclined tendons or haunches is not as easy.
The difference of the longitudinal forces between two beam sections is done by AQB only
for DESI, not for STRE. This latter will be done in the post processing in WINGRAF with
the Option "‘total bond force"’.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-23AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
For the last two methods, the calculated shear is always the sum of all shear flows. If the
material has multiple connections, the differences have to be established manually:

The most common formula for a cracked section uses the maximum shear and an empirical
reductionbasedontheratiooftheseparatedcompressiveortensileforces. Iftherearetensile
(T) and compressive forces (C) within a section the difference of the ratios has to be used, to
obtain the same results if the upper and lower side should yield the same values:

Figure2.8: CompressiveorTensileForces
For the strut method three forces have to be considered:
• the tensile force in the shear links or inclined longitudinal bars
• the compressive force or stress in the struts
• the tensile force in the longitudinal direction of the beam.
The inclination of the shear links and the struts may be chosen arbitrarily. A gently inclination
willreducetherequiredshearlinkarea,butwillincreasethelongitudinaltensileforce. AQBwill
therefore select the most gently inclination with an admissible compressive stress. However
a defined large minimum reinforcements for the shear links will increase that angle to reach
an utilisation close to 1.0. Higher values can be specified explicitly in the record TVAR as
described in DESI. There are different values possible for the web, compressive or tensile
flanges and every individual cut-definition.
The basic principle for the shear design is always a shear force T acting in the walls of an
equivalentholloworopenthinwalledsectionwhichmaybeobtainedbythreedifferenttheories:
For biaxial bending V is taken on the safe side as the norm of the shear force vector (Vy,Vz).
Z and Z are, respectively, the total and partial tension force in the detached part of the cross
section. D and D are the compressive forces.
Theleverarmoftheinternalforceszcomesfromthebendingdesign,orbyexplicitspecification
in AQUA. In this case one must note however that an inserted minimum reinforcement parallel
to the axis reduces the lever arm and that the result of a local design especially with a high
bending capacity has to be modified by a reduction of the compressive zone. AQB received
therefore a whole series of plausibility checks. The inclination of the compression struts is
designated as θ(former α) and the inclination of the links with respect to the section face as
α(former β).
The tensile force in the links is computed including the normal stress perpendicular to the cut

In case of counteracting shear loads, the principal compressive stress and the link reinforce-
ment are computed from a truss with an average inclination of the compression struts and
the resulting shear load. The designer must account for whether this is in concordance with
the codes in all cases. Whereas Eurocode EC 2 makes explicit provision for this, the old DIN
standardsrequiredseparatecalculations,whichthoughdonotalwaysyieldmeaningfulresults
(e.g. by inclined links).
A deduction from the web width of a shear cut can be defined in AQUA, in order to account for
the weakening due to ungrouted ducts.
The superposition of the computed reinforcement is controlled by the record REIN.
AQB can handle also many cases of bi-axial shear loading, however, these are not to be
believed under no circumstances uncritically. Especially if the resultant shear force is not per-
pendicular to the neutral axis within certain limits, a real 3D non-linear truss analysis may be
the only choice to obtain reliable results.
2.7.3 Shear Design according to Design Codes
The differences in the various codes consist in the limits on the inclination of the compression
struts and the portion of the shear force that must be covered. In most codes there is a part of
the concrete and a part of the shear links contributing to the total shear.
The problem is now, that most design codes describe the matter based on a rectangular sec-
tion. Thedesigncheckisbasedeitheronadmissiblestressesorbycomparingthetotaldesign
shear force or torsional moment with the ultimate resisting force or moment. While the first
method has no problems with complicated sections it is not very economical. The second
method on the other side will become rather difficult for a complex section. The method used
byAQBliesinbetweenandisstatedaspossibledesignmethodintheEurocodeinthechapter
about interaction of torsion and transverse shear.

paring the design shear force VEd with the resisting shear forces of the compression struts
VRd,c andofthereinforcementVRd,s. AQBuseshoweverinternallyshearfluxes(kN/m). Where
ever the norm uses V = b·h·... or V = b·d·.. or V = b·z.., AQB treats the flux T=V/h resp.
V/d resp. V/z and the corresponding shear stress. AQB reports the reinforcement required
by this design, as well as a permissible principal compressive stress or torsional shear stress.

2.7.4 Shear Checks in Circular Cross Sections
In case of circular cross sections AQB uses as width according to a paper by Feltham a value
derived from the area above the resulting shear force and the effective height.
Design is always done for the uniaxial resulting components of the forces or moments.
The inclination of the shear links will be accounted for according to Bender [2].

2.8 Stress Checks with Non-linear Material Behaviour
2.8.1 General Principles
Thedeterminationofastressstatewhileaccountingforthematerialpropertiesisthebasisfor
many further checks. For this purpose, one must follow the procedure described in Section
2.4 to determine the strain under service loads or increased service loads. No strain limits nor
safety coefficients are in effect for this check. The user can apply a modified material law for
this check.
In general, this task can only be solved iteratively. To accomplish this, the strain level of the
cross section, which is defined by the strain in the centroid and the curvatures in the two
coordinatedirections,mustbevarieduntiltheinternalforcesandmomentsofthecrosssection
sufficiently match the external ones.
The so-called BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) method is used for the non-linear
iteration. From the differences between internal and external forces a direction of change is
computedforthestrainlevel,anditerationproceedsinthisdirectionuntilitreachesanoptimum
point. This procedure is called line-search, and its precision can be controlled by some input
fortheCTRLrecord. Startingfromthecalculatedoptimumpoint,anewdirectionisdetermined
in the next step of iteration, using all the information computed thus far.
The mathematical prerequisite of convexity means, from mechanical perspective, that if the
curvature increases the internal moment must increase too. If stress-strain curves with falling
branches are defined, the solution can become ambiguous and the procedure may run into
difficulties.
Either the serviceability stress-strain curves or the ultimate stress-strain curves or an impute
mean value stress-strain curve with or without safety coefficients defined in AQUA may be
applied. As the choice of the correct curve may have considerable effect on the results, each
usershouldcarefullyselectthebestcurvealonghisknowledgeoropinion. Asaguide-linethe
EC2 states the following rules:
• The evaluation of deformations and the distribution of forces should use the mean values
(Ecm, fctm) in general. (A 2.1 (3))
• For bracing elements, i.e. those where a lower stiffness is unfavourable, the mean values
oftheconcretehavetobedividedbyasafetyfactorofthematerial. (A3.4(6)undA3.1(6)).
As these factors do not coincide with those of the design itself, they have to be specified
with the stress-strain law within AQUA.
2-28 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
• For the evaluation of the ultimate limit state one has to use design values. (A 2.1 (4)).
• For the design with the total system, reduced safety factors for the loading as well as for
the concrete may be used. (A 3.1)

If no reinforcement has been computed, or if a single combination of forces and moments has
been defined externally, the program uses the minimum reinforcement ratios set in AQUA.

2.8.3 Strain Check
When some code requires observing certain maximum strains or checking that the neutral
axis runs only as far as the gravity centre, these values can be taken directly from the results
printout.
2.8.4 Stress Range of the Reinforcement
The stress range of the reinforcement is computed and verified, upon request, for all defined
load cases or combinations thereof. The stress range is derived from the maximum and mini-
mum steel stresses of all reinforcement elements in all of the examined load cases.
2.8.5 Crack Width Check
The basis of the check in accordance with many design codes is the calculation of a crack
width by the expression:
 k = β · s rm · (ε sm−ε cm) (2.47)
where srm is the mean crack spacing, ε sm the mean strain of the steel, ε cm the mean strain
of the concrete between the cracks and β an optional safety coefficient (old EC 2 = 1.7). The
requireddesigncrackwidthwk isprescribedinAQB.Thereducedcoefficientforrestraintmust
be defined for thick cross sections through the explicit input of this value.
The two characteristic values are determined from the following expressions:
s rm = k 3c + k 1k 2k 4 · D/ρ z (2.48)

AQB determines the first crack stress according to a more precise method, that also

Other design codes like the SNIP use completely other formulas or establish additional con-

reinforcement element. The value for the total reinforcement is computed by AQB by reducing
the height of the tension zone.
h eƒƒ = mn{2.5 · (h−d) , (h−) , h/2} (2.55)
Although the design codes specify d as the distance to the centroid of the reinforcements, it is
much more appropriate to use the distance to the resulting tensile force of the reinforcements.
The reduction of the tension zone height to the bottom third is not appropriate in practice,
becausetheaxialforceeffectsmaymakethetensionzonebecomesosmallthatthereinforce-
ment is located in the upper third of the tension zone. AQB presupposes a height here of at
least 2.0·(c-D/2) for this height.
The factor 2.5 is valid only for concentrated reinforcements and thin elements as stated in the
German national annexe. For thick sections DIN 1045-1 specifies two curves for bending and
centricconstraining,referencedintheGermanannexetoEN1992onlybythelimitsh/d1≤10
resp. h/d1≤5.
In consistency with the theoretical derivation, reinforcement with differing diameters or bond
characteristics (such as prestressing steel) is dealt with in such a way that the sum of the
components is made up according to the following formula:

of this area becomes less than or equal to 0.09 m2, a uniform distribution is assumed and
the tendon is entered by its maximum value. For areas larger than 0.09 m2, only a proportion
reduced by 0.09/AR is entered.
The minimum reinforcement based on the tensile stresses can be determined with the record
STRE.
2.8.6 Other Checks for Crack Width
Other design codes use admissable stresses based on the diameter or spacing of the rein-
forcements. Both values may be specified in AQUA for any reinforcement element.

SOFiSTiK2023 2-31AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
The requirement of a square with 30 cm long sides is fulfilled in that a reference area AR can
be defined for the tendons. If the value of this area becomes less than or equal to 0.09 m2,
a uniform distribution is assumed and the tendon is entered by its maximum value. For areas
larger than 0.09 m2, only a proportion reduced by 0.09/AR is entered.
The maximum over this region is used for the stress in the steel or the stress increase. Partic-
ular reinforcement elements referring to a partial area can also be checked, if the appropriate
values have been defined in AQUA.
2.8.7 Determination of Non-linear Stiffnesses
There are various options for considering the results of the strain state in an iterative static
analysis. The general relationship for moments an curvatures :

Thismethodologymayyieldtherightresultsafteraniterativecalculationformanycases. How-
ever, if EIyz deviates significantly from zero, the stiffnesses, which are defined in this manner,
can become considerably higher than the elastic values. And the formulas are not applica-
ble in this form for any initial stress or temperature gradients. A fully cracked unsymmetrically
reinforced sections with zero curvature would still yield a moment, thus the stiffness becomes
infinite. Thiseffectcouldbetreatedwithlargeeffortbyashiftedcenterofgravity. TheSOFiSTiK
approach however is to select useable ”non linear effective elasticity moduli” referred to the
gross sectional area, which may become also larger than the elastic stiffness. The orientation
of the principal axes is maintained by a variation of the stiffness EIyz. Then the corresponding
plastic deformations are calculated. For the regular case EIyz=0, the following equations may
be used:
N  = E A · (ε 0 − ε 0,p) (2.62)
M y = E y y · (k y − k y,p) (2.63)
M z = E z z · (k z − k z,p) (2.64)
2-32 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
An iterative analysis of the structure is generally possible by a great variety of methods. As
a true incremental tangential stiffness is not yet available we have to concentrate on three
variants of a secant stiffness formulation:
1. Secant stiffness
The curvatures ky and kz and the moments yield new stiffnesses according to equations and
. This method is usually the fastest. It may though become unstable in the neighbourhood of

There are three additional sub-variants possible in each case, which affect the determination
of the strain state.

continues to be changed until the internal matches the external axial force. The internal mo-
ments MY and MZ, which are normally smaller than the external ones, and the old curvatures
yield the new stiffnesses and plastic curvatures. This method approaches from below and
therefore always works, but it requires more iterations.
The default is the S1 method with automatic acceleration. In systems with only slightly utilised
cross sections, SN will generally give quicker results. In case of systems close to the ultimate
load, one should switch to K1, and perhaps reduce the automatic acceleration.
2-34 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
Effect of axial force
The preceding methods of type S are only limitedly suitable for a calculation of non-linear ef-
fectsfromaxialforce,sinceinreinforcedconcretethestrainofthecentroidveryoftenbecomes
positive despite a negative axial force. The secant stiffness which is to be found would then
become negative. The type K procedures, with a plastic strain of the centroid axis, function
even in this case, however.
However, the calculation is not entirely free of problems for statically indeterminate systems,
since these plastic strains can create very high axial forces. For this reason the plastic strains
are used only in the extended K procedures, although they could theoretically be used in the
S procedures also. As a consequence calculations with plastic redistributions from axial force
can only be handled with these procedures.
Tension Stiffening
For a realistic determination of the stiffnesses, the cooperative effect of the concrete between
the cracks (tension stiffening) must be considered. This can be taken into account in AQB in
accordancewithEurocodeEC2ortheheft525,bydeterminingthecrackwidths. Insteadofthe
steel-strain for cracked condition, the mean steel strain is used for calculating the curvatures.

2.8.8 Interaction between Shear and Axial Stresses
On calculations to systems in the area of the ultimate load, the mutual influence of axial
stresses caused from bending and axial force with the shear stresses caused from torsion
and shear force has to be taken into account.
To accomplish this, two possibilities are available:
1. Reduction of stiffness
Especially for concrete sections a certain reduction of torsion and shear stiffness based on
the size of the compression zone and the reduction of the normal and bending stiffness is
implemented. This option will be activated with CTRL INTE S.
2. Interaction of stresses
For thin walled sections Katz Katz [3] has published a method where the stresses in selected
intgeration points within the section will be reduced according the plasticity theory. The total
shearstrainsarethenscaledtoacchieveequilibriumbetweeninternalandexternalforcesand
moments.
A keyword INTE has been provided which may have one of the following values for steel:
CTRL INTE 0 No interacction
CTRL INTE 1 Interaction with isotrope Reduction
CTRL INTE 2 Interaction with Prandtl-Flow Rule (Default)
CTRL INTE 3 Interaction with shear preference
Sometimes for concrete and timber no such interaction is desired within a composite section
asallshearshouldbetransferedtothesteelparts. ButwithanexplizitdefinitionofCTRLINTE
CONC 1 fact shear stress in concrete parts will be limited to the maximum shear as given in
the design codes multiplied with fact.
Interaction method for Steel
For all sections the elastic variation of the stresses in the section is known. For every thin-
walled cross section element (panel) during determination of the internal forces in three se-
lected points (Gauss-Legendre Points) the elastic stresses will be calculated:
- An axial stress σ-x constant about the thickness
- A constant shear stress about the thickness caused from shear force, from shear flow
after Bredt and secondary torsion τ-m
- An increase of stress towards the boundary caused from Saint-Venant torsion Δt
The von Mises flow rule will be evaluated to a point at distance t/6 from the boundary with the
highest stresses.
For detailed FEM-sections (CTRL FEM 1 or 2) a similar procedure is implemented for every
FEM colocation point.
During yielding redistribution of stresses caused from constraints in the cross section may
occur. Howeverthesecanbetakenintoaccountonlywithathreedimensionalnon-linearfinite
2-36 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
element analysis. Therefore in AQB the yield condition is taken into consideration in the form
of an elastic part:
ƒ
y
α = (2.70)
(cid:112) σ2+3τ2
For σ the elastic stress E ·ε will be used. Afterwards the non-linear stresses will be defined
equal to the elastic stresses multiplied by α. They will be integrated each part separately to
the cross section forces. Three different methods for the determination of the elastic part are
implemented. The default is the method according to Prandtl with one flow rule.
For the determination of the inner torsional moment the parts of the open cross section are
decollated determines to the shear flow after Bredt. The Bredt shear flow is influenced mainly
through the thinner point of the cross section. The minimum factor αof all sections parts with
Bredt shear flow will be calculated therefore and this factor will be applied to the total torsional
moment.

• Deactivate the fatigue design check with λ = 0.0.
The design check is carried out using the allowed stress range defined for the material. It
is assumed that in this value the partial safety factor for the material is already included. If
a reduction of the allowed stress range has to be considered for bent bars (e.g. stirrup re-
inforcement), it is necessary to assign to these reinforcements materials with corresponding
properties. For the simplified check acc. EN 1992-1-1 6.8.6 it is also possible to explicitly set
the allowed stress range with the option SIGS in record NSTR.

bond behavior. This is accomplished with the formula:
A + A
s p
η = (2.80)
A + A (cid:200) ξ d s
s p d
p
The correction for A p is also applied to A s if there are different bond factors or diameters. This
formula may yield very large values if the reinforcement is defined with a very small area.
A rather nasty problem is the evaluation of the shear. The DIN design code allows a simple
solution based on a corrected value for the inclination of the compressive struts:
(cid:112)
tnθ ƒtge = tnθ (2.81)
Unfortunately it is nearly impossible to keep this value from the shear design for all individual
shear cuts or transform it to different load combinations and reinforcement distributions for
the fatigue stress check. AQB uses instead a fixed value of 4/7 for the tangents. The user
may overwrite this value however with any desired value. As AQB uses the modified internal
lever of forces based on the real stress distribution, an increase of the shear stress is already
activated. If this circumstances allow a classification of a ”more detailed design” is up to the
users decision.

2.10 Special Effects of Design according to DIN
As the DIN codes develop in parallel to the Euro-codes, the user has to pay special attention
to the correct selection of the design codes.
2.10.1 Shear Checks According to DIN 4227 Zone a
A check in accordance with DIN 4227 Zone a is carried out when a stress check with ultimate
loads under uncracked conditions (Stage I) with the record STRE has been requested.
The inclination of the truss struts is computed based on the stresses of an uncracked stage:

The lower limit of 0.4 for a is not applicable in the determination of the principle compres-
sive stresses (see Volume 320 of DAfStB [ Deutscher Ausschuss für Stahlbeton = German
Committee for Reinforced Concrete] ). An inclination of 45 degrees is specified for torsion.

For cross sections with torsional stresses according to the integral equation method, AQUA
choosesaconservativeaverageshearstress,whichcanleadtoaslightoverdesign(e.g. 3%).
The minimum reinforcement is used according to table 5 of A1 and the the explanations
about that from Tue, König, Pommerening (Bautechnik 1999) (Differences in particular at wide
beams).
When checking the principal tensile stresses at boundary points, longitudinal tensile stresses
are not taken into consideration (Section 12.2.(1)).
No reinforcement is computed by this design for sections, of which the stress limit has been
exceeded(ZoneB).Theprincipalstressescanbecomputed,however,andtheycanbeoutput
with ECHO SHEA EXTR. The stress limits are checked separately for each material.
The rules of Zone b are always applicable for tensioned flanges (Section 12.4.2 (4)).
2.10.2 Shear Checks According to DIN 4227 Zone b
A check in accordance with DIN 4227 Zone b is carried out when a bending design with shear
reinforcement has been requested.
WhencheckinginaccordancewithDIN4227,thecalculatedstressiscomparedwiththelower
and upper values of the design limits. The inclination of the truss struts is computed by the
expression:

If a check in accordance with Zone a (STRE) has been performed in the same input block,
thesocomputedreinforcementisnotsavedifthemaximumstresslimithasnotbeenreached.
The corresponding cuts are marked with A or I (uncracked Stage I) instead of B. If this is not
the case, this reinforcement will be selected.
Since the stress limit in uncracked Stage I is only approximately calculated here for an ideal
crosssection,withadeviationofafewpercentagepoints,itispossibleinrarecasesthatsome
sections will not be designed in either case. For cross sections with more than one material,
the program checks the value of stress limit whose material number was defined by the SECT
record.
The rules of Zone a are always applicable for compressed flanges (Section 12.4.2 (6)).

2.10.3 Crack Width according to DIN 4227 Appendix A1
TheevaluationoftheminimumreinforcementaccordingtoDIN4227A1isbasedontheelastic
stress distribution and is therefore a post-processing option to the design step STRE. Correc-
tions given by Tue/König/Pommerening have been incorporated.
• The minimum reinforcement is increased for wide beams (not slabs) with b0>2d0.
• Changed definition of d0 for kc (6.7.3.)
Further the following assumptions have to be defined:
• The material which shows the smallest compressive stress for the limit LIMA becomes
decisive.
• The direction of the reference line is determined by means of the stress distribution includ-
ing all residual stresses in this material.
• Coefficientkisinterpretedasthethinnestplaceinthecrosssectiontodeterminefromwall

definition of bond stress ratios is not required.
2.10.4 Shear Design according to DIN 1045 (1988)
The design of non-prestressed construction elements according to DIN 1045 examines the
shear regions for beams with the defined stress limits, and performs a reduction of the shear
stress if appropriate beam sections have been defined. No shear stresses are computed in
between the defined beam sections. The inclination of the compression struts of the truss is
always assumed to be 45 degrees. The input value TANA is thus the minimum factor of the
shear coverage. The following shear regions are considered:
Ia. without reinforcement (plates, rectangular cross section only)
τ 0 ≤ k · τ 01 τ=0. (2.87)
Ib. minimum reinforcement (beams)
τ 0 ≤ τ 01 τ=0.4τ 0 (2.88)
II. reduced shear coverage

In case of fully tensioned cross sections, the design is based on the principle tensile stress
computedinuncrackedStageIwithoutfurtherreduction. Fornumericalreasons,onlysections,
bywhichthe1/1.75-multipleofthetensileconcretestrengthisexceeded,areconsideredtobe
fully tensioned. In case of fully compressed cross sections the design is similarly performed in
Stage I, yet a reduction is permitted.
If needed, the principal compressive stress is checked by analogy with DIN 4227.
The preset shear stress limits are appropriately increased for design under ultimate loads.
2.10.5 Shear Design according DIN 1045-1 (2001)
The shear design deviates in some points from the Eurocode especially for the minimum rein-
forcement and inclination of the struts.
2.11 Special Effects of Design according OENORM
2.11.1 Concrete Shear Design according to old OeNORM
Designing according to old OeNORM is still available using a truss analogy, with a standard
inclination of 45 degrees. Differentiation is made between B 4200, B 4250 and B 4253 as far
as the application of the reduction. The code provides for a reference stress τ 1. The following
stress limits are defined in B4200:
T01 ( 2 τ 1)
τ V ≤ T02 (10 τ 1)
τ T ≤ T02 (10 τ 1)
τ V+T ≤ T03 (12 τ 1)
as well as a reduction force
V red = b0 · z · τ 1
B 4200 designs for:
Minimum reinforcement, if τ V ≤ T01
V reduced by Vred, if τ V ≥ T01 and τ T ≤ T01
full shear force, if τ V ≥ T01 and τ T ≥ T01
B 4250 designs for ultimate loads. The reduction value is thus increased. The clause with the
torsional stress is cancelled in this case.
Minimum reinforcement, if τ V ≤ T01
V reduced by 1.4·Vred, if τ V ≥ T01
B 4253 does not contain any reduction value, the inclination of the truss is reduced instead
2-42 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
according to 12.2.2.(3) :
tan α = 0.6 to 1.0 by 0.0 to 2.5 o/oo tensile strain
2.11.2 Design according to OENORM B 4700
The B 4700 is similar to the Eurocode, but there are deviations. The most significant is the
different definition of concrete class based on the cubic strength.
Some how uncertain is 2.4.2. (3). The steel strain will not be checked by AQB. We believe
that the provision of symmetric reinforcements in those cases by AQB will cover the intended
requests.
For the inclination of the diagonals of the truss model we have the formulas (23) and (24) of
OENORM. The lower limit of 0.4 is only allowed for continuous reinforcement. This has to be
specified in REIN as SPAN.
The serviceability check uses a given interpolation factor between tables 7/8 and 9/10. Table
9 and 10 have been extended for smaller stresses according to the theoretical base.
The B 4750 has additional factors for the creep coefficients if the strength is higher than 35
MPa. The deductional areas of tendons is always the full duct area.
2.12 Design according to SIA
The mean value of permissible inclination for shear force and torsion is freely selectable be-
tween 25 and 45 degrees within SIA 262, the maximum allowed shear is given by equation
(40):
V Rd,c = b zk cƒ cd(cosα + cotβsnα)snα (2.92)
The coefficients kc will be selected based on the stress distribution and the CUT-properties
WEB / FLAN.
The coefficient kfor plates without shear links is taken as 3.0 and modified according to the
steel strength and the grading of the longitudinal reinforcements. Modifications according to
the maximum grain have to be specified explicitly.
2.13 Design according to French BAEL
Shear design according to BAEL-91 as modified in the year 1999 still uses the deductional
stressmethod. Theadmissiblestressesdependontheinclinationoftheshearlinks(A5.1,21),

of the concrete depending on the normal force and bending stresses. (A5.1,23).
The design for cracking is done via a limit for the stresses according to A.4.5,323.
2.14 Design according to Italian Code
Theministerialdecretfrom1996allowsthedesignaccordingtotheECwiththeItalianmaterial
definitions. But there still exists the old method with a deductional stress. A special option
is the parameter δ, which has a value between 0 and 2 depending on the normal force and
SOFiSTiK2023 2-43AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
the decompression moment. This value is then applied as a factor to the shear force of the
concrete. Further it has to be noted that the admissible shear stress is depending on the
inclination of the shear links. This document contains also a regulation for the use of the old
EC2 with the formulas of the eurocode and the materials of the DM-1996. (Safety factor of
concrete is 1.6, Inclination of struts in truss model is 0.5 < tan < 1.0 etc.).
NTC (Norme Tecniche) of year 2005 was an intermediate solution, where material safety
(1.9/1.5) was referred on the cubical strength Rck of the concrete. The crack width accord-
ing Table 5.1-X is also depended on the sensitivity of the reinforcement, and the stresses had
to be checked for the serviceability condition according to table 5.1-XI and 5.1-XII depending
on the environmental conditions.
TheNTC(NormeTecniche)ofyear2008isnownearlyidenticaltotheEN1992fastvollständig
überein. Small deviations are in the material parameters only. Formulas for the crack width
have to be taken from the comment however, they are not included in the design code itself.
Also for non linear analysis detailed provisions are not given.
2.15 Design according to Spanish EHE
At the first glance the regulations for the EHE are very similar to those of the German DIN
1045-1, however the design is rather different as the EHE uses still a possible deduction of
shear, which is for vertical links as follows:
cotθ

The design will be done by a scaled shear stress V/bd, a deductional shear stress τ c·β and
the maximum allowed shear stress of v-u1 = V1/bd.

ontheinclinationoftheshearlinks. Thecrackwidthiscontrolledbyarathersimpleformulafor

2-44 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
2.17 Design according to Swedish BBK
The Swedish design code have the special provision that the safety factor for the material has
two parts: First η•γ m (= 1.5 for concrete) for the material itself, which is defined with the
material in AQUA, then a second safety class factor γ n dependant on the type of the structure
which is defined when selecting the design code and thus will preset the safety factors for
DESI.
There are no special effects for the bending design, but for the shear a deduction method is
foreseen where the concrete capacity is dependant on the normal stress, the prestress and
the existing longitudinal reinforcement. (Sections 3.7.3 and 3.7.4.)
2.18 Design according to British Standard
Design for normal force and moments according to BS has no specialities compared to the
standardmethods. Thepredefinedstress-strainlawsareallweneed. Forthecheckofstresses
for bridges the user must prescribe the admissible stresses in general. Shear design is imple-
mented according to BS 8110 and BS 5400:Part4:1990. For the latter the user has to select
the class of the sections. Then you have to distinguish between:
• Shear force ”Section uncracked in flexure (equation 28)”
(cid:114)
V co = 0.67 · b · h · (ƒ t2+ƒ cp · ƒ t) (2.95)
• Shear force ”Section cracked in flexure (equation 29), class 1 and class 2 only
M
(cid:198) cr
V cr = 0.037 · b · d · ƒ c + · V (2.96)
M
The ratio Mcr/M will be derived from the forces of the given combination via the normal
stresses, which allows an immediate scaling of the shear force or stress.
• Section cracked in flexure (equation 30), class 3 only
(cid:18) F (cid:19) M
pe o
V cr+ = −0.55 · ·  c · b · d + · V (2.97)
F M
p
Also for this case everything is treated via the ratio Mo/M and not V/M. Theoretically the
ratio V/M should be evaluated for every load pattern, but this would require to perform all
superpositions within AQB. We believe that the evaluation of the ratio for the given combi-
nation is sufficient in general.

The depth d is according to the code the distance from the outmost compression fibre to the
centre of gravity of the reinforcements, but not less than 0.8·h.
There is no remark within the text of the standard if V/M includes forces from prestress. As it
is generally intended to work on the ultimate forces and as there is no specific safety factor for
prestress available, we use only external load contributions according to our technical knowl-
edge: If you consider the ratio M/Mcr, the part of the shear force of the concrete will become
zero if prestress and tensile strength is fully used from the external moment. From that follows
thatMmustnotincludeprestresswhileVistheshearforceincludingpartsofinclinedtendons.
According to the standard the shear part of the inclined tendons has to be added to the resis-
tance Vc0 (uncracked) but not to the resistance Vcr (cracked), which is not followed by AQB.
For the evaluation of the reinforcements V should include those parts.
Theoretically one has to consider all beam sections for all load cases to select the side of the
section to have compression or tension for the evaluation of Mcr and d. We use a bounding
rectangle with its corners and midsides for this purpose.

classical mechanics, which is compensated by much lesser admissible stresses compared to

the stresses from AQUA will be multiplied with a factor of 1.25 similar to equation 10a.

2.19 Design according ACI / AASHTO
ACI and AASHTO have been published in a metric SI and in an imperial units version.
SOFiSTiKusesthemetricversionwhereeverpossible. Theconversionoftheconstantswithin
these standards is not very precise, thus you have to expect some small but remarkable devi-
ations.
As the AASHTO 2002 has foreseen allowable stress and STRENGTH-Design as alternate
methods,andtheappendixAoftheACIhasbeenwithdrawn2002,wesupplyonlythesecond
variant. Checks for allowable stresses according to 9.15.2. for prestressed concrete members
are not fully covered automatically (only 0.6 fc’).
With the appearance of the ACI 02 several important changes have been introduced, however
the old provisions still exist in Appendix B and C, which are available with a separate INI-file.
Minimal moments according 8.17.1 of AASHTO may be selected via the literal MCR as load
type at any combination. The factor is then to be defined as 1.2.
The safety factors of the materials are expected with their inverse faktors (ACI and AAHSTO
nearly identical):
Tension, Bending and tensional bending: 0.90
Compression and compressive bending: 0.65
Shear 0.85
Forsmallcompressiveforcesthesafetyfactorwillbeinterpolatedaccordingtothesteelstrain.
Theoldversionbasedontheminimumfrom0.1·fc·AandthenormalforcePb ofthe ”balanced
strain condition” is only available with the 318-99 version. This estate of ”balanced strain
condition” will be evaluated first if the section is not fully under compressive stresses. The
safety factor is then evaluated and will be kept despite of any changes of strain within the
iteration.
Minimumreinforcementaccordingto10.5.1and10.5.3willbeconsidered,10.5.2howevernot.
The referenced area of the section will be scaled with d/h. If the relative bearing capacity is
larger than 1.3 the minimum reinforcement will be reduced accordingly.
Additional moments according to 10.12.3. will be only applied if a value for BETA at record
BEAM is defined. We use Cm=1.0 and beta-d=0.6. Sway frames with slenderness ratios
larger than 100 require a more detailed analysis via STAR2.
Shear design will follow chapter 11.3.2. of ACI resp. 5.8.3. (2002: 8.16.6) of AASHTO. For
prestressed sections we need according to 11.4.2. the values V and Mm of a different load
case than that actually worked on, which is a problem for AQB. Also the evaluation of Mcr
needs values from other combinations.
To cope with all these requirements:
1. The combination MAX-M has to be designed before the combination MAX-V. Then
only AQB will remember the maximum values.
2. ForthecalculationofMcr uniaxialbendingisassumed. Theloadcasesofpermanent
SOFiSTiK2023 2-47AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
actionshavetobedefinedassuchwithintheloadcombinationtoallowtheevaluation
of the ”unfactored dead load”.
3. The shear part of inclined tendons will only be used for Vc. This is a deviation of
the standard AQB procedure which implies that this part will have the security factor
of 0.85 applied or if Vc < Vc will not be used at all.
Shear-Friction according 11.7.4. is not yet accounted for.
The depth d is according to the code the distance from the outmost compression fibre to the
centre of gravity of the reinforcements, but not less than 0.8·h.
AASHTO LRFD (2004) describes the shear design in chapter 5.8.3./4. in detail and rather
complex. If AQUA has defined the crack spacing parameter se for a section, the design will
be made using table 2, otherwise the values of Table 1 are used. The strain ε  will be always
taken for the mid of the shear cut.
Torsion within the ACI relies for the reinforcements exactly on the equivalent hollow section,
but for the allowed stresses there is a simplified formula (11.6.1 resp. 11.6.3). AQB treats the
value of Mt·U/1.7·A2 of 11.6.3 as real shear stress and factorises it for 11.6.1. Variant b of
this formula is not accounted for. For the inclination of the struts there is always a value of 45
degrees. For prestressed sections this can be modified with input of DESI TANA 0.767 to the
37.5degreesforthetorsion. Minimumreinforcementaccordingto11.6.5.2. willbeconsidered,
11.6.5.3 however not.
Design of prestressed composite sections is only possible if the reference material is of type
concrete.
Chapters 9.5 ”Control of deflections” is not implemented, as AQB has much more sophisti-
cated methods available.
Crack width according to 10.6.4. has not been implemented.
Determination of creep and shrinkage coefficients is not suited for a computer program. The
have to be defined by the user himself explicitly.
2.20 Design according to Russian SP
SP63.13330.2012 has many specific formulas and regulations, that a 100 percent implemen-
tation is hardly possible within a general software. AQB has to generalize many provisions to
allow a design according to the SP in general cases.
Design according to knows two limit states: Group 1 (ultimate load) and Group 2 (Serviceabil-
ity). The selection of the safety coefficients is rather complex, as they depend not only on the
loading but also on other aspects. These factors should be either defined with the material
and/or as a factor on the saftey in AQB
2.20.1 Moment and Normal Force
For the bending design a constant stress block is foreseen with an optimal height given by
a value ξ R. If the compressive zone becomes larger additional compressive reinforcement
is needed. This provision is identical to the approach implemented in AQB with an optimum
tensile stress of the reinforcements. For the selected maximum compressive strain, the value
2-48 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|AQB
ξ R will define for every combination of materials an optimum tensile strain.
The minimum reinforcement according to rule 10.3.6 is dependent on the slenderness.
2.20.2 Shear and Torsion
The design for the shear force is done with a truss model. The angle of the truss model is
defined by a projected length c of the inclined section in figure 8.6:
c
cotθ = (2.101)
h
o
Lower and upper limits for c are given by ho and 2 ho for equation 8.58.
As the formula for the shear stress within the SNIP is only applicable for rectangular sections
and the web of a T-beam, AQB uses in all other cases the mechanical solution as with other
design codes. If required, a definition of a minimum value for the internal lever h o in AQUA
may be used to account for the same effect for other sections.

where  b1 = 0.3 and  n is defined according 8.1.34. The mean stress σ− pc is calculated

2.20.3 Serviceability and Crack Width
For the design for a single crack a moment has to be generated reaching the tensile strength,
which may be accomplished via the COMB record.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-49AQB|TheoreticalPrinciples
For the design of the completed crack pattern, chapter 8.2.15 gives the relation (8.128) for the
crack width acrc :

2.21 Design according to Australian Standards
Die Australian design codes AS 3600 / AS 5100 and the New-Zealand NZS 3101 deviate in
details,buthavemuchincommon. Thesafetyfactorsareimplementedas ”strength-reduction
factors” ϕ < 1.0. The AS has a rather complicated scheme to establish this factor (Table 2.3),
which is based on the design of the moment without normal force and a modification of the
reduction factor caused by the normal force. This method is definitely not suitable for AQB at
all.
HoweverAQBtakescareofthecriticalheightofthecompressivezonewithcoefficientk =0.4
according to row b. For a compressive strain of -3.0 per mille this yields an optimal steel strain
of +4.5 per mille. The safety factor is then interpolated depending on the steel strain exactly
as in the ACI and a compressive reinforcement is provided. In 2005 a similar interpolation
depending on the relative height k0 has been introduced.
This coefficient ϕ will be modified depending on the axial forces. However this requires the
knowledgeofthereinforcements,Thusaproperevaluationisonlypossiblewithadesigncheck
for a given reinforcement which follows the common design practice with manual calculations.
Thedesignmaybeperformedwithanysuitableparabola-rectangulardiagramoraspecialcon-
stant stress block, which has been implemented but is not activated as default. The maximum
stress value is reduced with a factor to 0.85 fc’, the height of the block is reduced according
8.1.2.2.
Creepandshrinkagevaluesaccordingtoprovisionsofparagraph6.1areavailablecompletely.
Shear design has a shear strength vc from the concrete according to paragraph 8.2.7. and
a part of the reinforcements according 8.2.9/10. The maximum shear stress for shear and
torsion is 0.2 fc’. A linear interaction is defined.
Check against cracking is performed based on an admissible stress in the reinforcements
according to tables. 8.6.1 a/b. For prestressed concrete the maximum tensile stress will be
compared with the mean value of thetensile strength. Ifthat value is exceededthe stell stress
will be limited to 200 MPa according clause 8.6.2.

3 Description of Input
3.1 Input Language
The input is done in a free format with the CADINP input language (see the general manual
SOFiSTiK: ’FEA / STRUCTURAL Installation and Basics’).
Three categories of units are distinguished:
mm Fixed unit. Input is always required in the specified unit.
[mm] Explicit unit. Input defaults to the specified unit. Alternatively, an explicit as-
signment of a related unit is possible (eg. 2.5[m] ).
[mm] Implicit unit. Implicit units are categorised semantically and denoted by a cor-
1011
responding identity number (shown in green). Valid categories referring to the
unit ”length” are, for example, geodetic elevation, section length and thickness.
Thedefaultunitforeachcategoryisdefinedbythecurrentlyactive(designcode
specific) unit set. This input default can be overridden as described above. The
specified unit in square brackets corresponds to the default for unit set 5 (Eu-
rocodes, NORM UNIT 5).

Inputisdividedintoblocks,whichconcludewiththerecordEND.Withineachblock,anydesired
load case and beam combination may be selected and processed with the design operations.
The program is terminated when an empty block (END/END) is encountered.
The records HEAD, END and PAGE are described in the general manual SOFiSTiK: ’FEA /
STRUCTURAL Installation and Basics’.
3.3 Overview of the Design Operations
There are various design operations, each activated by a corresponding record. With the
exception of EIGE, every task may be selected multiple times.
The individual operations are:
EIGE Internal stresses in composite and pre-stressed concrete due to creep and
shrinkage or construction stage (AQBS only)
STRE Stress determination according to elasticity theory Sectional design based
on ultimate plastic forces
DESI Determinationofrequiredreinforcementorrelativeloadingcapacityincluding
shear safety for cracked conditions
3-2 SOFiSTiK2023DescriptionofInput |AQB
NSTR Determinationofstresses,strainsandstiffnesswithconsiderationofthema-
terial law, calculation of crack width and check of absolute or the range of
stresses
Saving results
Results of design (combination forces, reinforcements, stresses, utilisation factors) can be
savedinthedatabase. ThereinforcementhasitsowncasenumberLCR.FormoreDetailssee
record REIN. All other results will be saved under a load case number either identical to the
selectedloadcase(TYPE”(D)”etc)orspecifiedwithLCSTforanysuperpositioncombination.
For the latter case the design forces are also saved.
If an iteration with a static calculation of program STAR2 or ASE should take place, then in
most cases the records DESI, REIN and NSTR can be input directly in STAR2 or ASE. If the
requirements to the design differ, then a batch type iteration with ITER can be used instead
(see manual with general instructions).
3.4 Important changes to the Version 2016
With an explicit selection of a design code, only those sections will be designed, having a
reference material matching the scope of the design code.
The printout has been completely redesigned in tabular form. This implied some separations
in multiple tables to get a better overview. The ECHO control has been adopted.
AQUA creates now sections as finite elements. If this mesh should not be used for the design,
it may be deselected with CTRL FEM 0.

BEAM selects the sections or elements to be designed or defines external sections with a
section NCS. Only one type of elements can ever be processed in one input block. Thus
SOFiSTiK2023 3-37AQB|DescriptionofInput
the definition of BEAM should precede the selection of the load cases. The following are
considered to be of the same type:
BEAM,FLEX,COMP beam elements of database
DSLN,DBEA,DCOL results at design elements in the data base
TRUS truss elements of database
CABL cable elements of database
SECT ... SHEA external sections
These types can be defined in detail:
BEAM = beam elements
FLEX = beam elements as bending members
COMP = beam elements as compression members (cf. 2.5.2 or CTRL)
SLN = structural lines
SBEA = structural lines as bending members
SCOL = structural lines as compression members
TRUS = truss elements
CABL = cable elements
SECT = external section in bending members
SCOM = external section in compression members
FACE = support face
HFAC = support face, hinged support
IFAC = support face, indirect support
SHEA = external section, shear section
With the types FLEX and COMP, the otherwise valid differentiation between compression and
bending members with respect to the orientation to the gravity is overwritten. AQB checks
however eccentricity and magnitude of the axial force in every section against the selection. If
CS0 is selected, the default of TYPE is changed to FLEX.
Storage of non-linear stiffness with the record NSTR is possible only for the group belonging
to type BEAM.
If only TYPE is specified, all of the elements of this type are selected.
Instead of element numbers it is also possible to specify a primary or secondary group with
literal GRP or a structural line with literal SLN or a bridge axis with literal REF. The group or
axis designation is then to be specified at position TO, INC has no meaning in those cases. If
the referenced element is an axis, the values CS0 to CS1 may be specified as the name of a
variable at the axis with a maximum of 4 characters, defining the values along the axis.
If an X value or range is selected, only the corresponding sections are designed:
no definition = all sections
X textitff.fff = single section relative to start of beam
3-38 SOFiSTiK2023DescriptionofInput |AQB
X ff.fff "‘A"’ = single section relative to start of beam
XE ff.ffff = single section relative to end of beam
X ff.fff "‘E"’ = single section relative to end of beam
X ff.fff ff.fff = a range of sections between to ordinates
X can not be used to interpolate sections.
WithPREDaphysicalreductionoftheareaoftendons(e.g. duetocorrosion)maybespecified.
The coefficient length BETA is used for designing according to the overall effective length. For
abeamelementsitisrelativetotheassumedspanlength(seeCTRLCONTinSOFIMSHA),for
a structural line relative to its total length. It may be entered positive or negative. Only positive
values will enable some buckling design.
If the section has the same buckling curve for y and z bending, the values BETA/BETS are
taken for the strong and weak axis, if they are different, the values BETA/BETS are for the
buckling in the local z resp. y directions.
Enteringthisvaluedoesnotimplyhoweverthatallaspectsofstabilitydesignareautomatically
fulfilled. AsSOFiSTiKisdesignedtoperforminvestigationsoftheentireframestructure,onlya
few possibilities are programmed for this type of design. At the present time there is available:
• beamswhichareintendedtobecentrallycompressed(trussbracesorperpendiculartothe
plane of a frame) in accordance with DIN 18800 Part 2. Further information may be found
in the notes on the record STRE.
• for the design with additional moments according to:
DIN 1045 17.4.3
ÖNORM B 4700 2.4.3.
ACI 318 and IS 456
This design is intended only for certain ranges of slenderness, which will be checked. In
principal there will be always a two axis design. Printout of the additional moments is only
available for forces of combinations.
• for the design according to the Eurocode additional moments will be established based
on a simplified model column method, but this method is rather uneconomical for small
eccentricities (e/d < 0.1) or long columns (l>15d). Printout of the additional moments is
only available for forces of combinations.
Independent from the sign there are the following other effects:
• Fortendonstheincrementoftheforcewillbeboundedbythebondlimitsasgiveninchapter
13 of the DIN 4227.
Additional properties of the section will be defined by STYP. These are:

calculation of curvatures.
The coefficients LAMC, LAMT and LAMS are used to convert the stress range evaluated with
the program into a damage equivalent stress range. There are the following possibilities:

• < 0.0 the check of Δσ <|λ| · Δσ k/γ

3.8.1 External sections
In general, the user processes only the results of the database or individual external forces
and moments of the load case zero. In order to be able to use the extensive possibilities for
formingcombinations,ofcreepstagesandofsheardesigns,itispossibletodefineanexternal
static system which is defined and managed independently of the existing system.
Thissystemisdescribedbymeansoftheexternalsections. Theusermustdefineeverysection
with a beam number FROM and with an x value in increasing order and a section number.
Whensuchasectionhasbeendefined,allfurtherinputsofTYPESECTareinterpretedasthe
defaults.
The system is stored separately in the database, and can be reactivated for later computing
runs with BEAM TYPE SECT.
Since tendons and internal forces and moments are also stored under the defined beam type
inthedatabase,boththeloadcasesandthetendonsmustbeenteredafterthebeamsections.
For an example of this, see example t-beam-bridgesection.dat.
3.8.2 Construction stages
For the description of construction stages the user has to select an arbitrary but unique num-
bering scheme. Each change of the section, installation or grouting of tendons should have
its own number. The recommended scheme is to use numbers 10,20 etc. for constructional
phases,while11,21areusedforpoststressingand15,25forthegroutingprocess. WithAQBS
everybeamorbeam sectioncanbeassignedupto31different crosssectionsfordetermining
stress (e.g. gross, net, ideal). These are designated as gross and construction stage sections
CS0 to CS31.
Each section in AQUA may have up to 9 construction phases, each with a construction stage
number. If CS0 is defined with the literal AUTO, all CS values defined in AQUA will be used to
definetheconstructionstages,forliteralAUTXthevaluesinAQUAwilltriggerthestages+0,+1
and +5. The definition of higher construction stages may be done with multiple continuation
lines as described below. Every row with the literal CS+X will shift the assigned CS numbers
by 10, i.e. the second line defines the values for CS10 to CS19:
BEAM 1001 1099 CS0 10 CS1 11 ......
CS+X CS0 101 CS1 102
Hint
When using this option none of the records must contain generation or list expressions!
Every load case is also assigned to a distinct construction stage. Its forces are acting on the
section with the highest construction stage less or equal than the stage of the load case. It is
also possible to assign a load case to an explicit stage (e.g. CS3), this allows to use different
3-40 SOFiSTiK2023DescriptionofInput |AQB
construction stages in one load case or to select always the second construction stage for the
post-stressing.
Further for every tendon three construction stage numbers are defined (values ICS1 to ICS3).
Each tendon can be installed, grouted, or extended to a particular stage. Only the very first
tendon should have ICS1=ICS2, because the program has to distinguish between the estates
before and after the extrusion very carefully. The following conventions are in effect for the
stage CSi:
Empty duct
Tendons with CSi < ICS1 or CSi > ICS3 are present only with their duct as deductional area.
Unextruded tendon
Tendons with CSi > ICS1 and CSi < ICS2 are calculated with their steel area without bond
and with their duct as deductional area. In ultimate load design, the prestressing is calculated
with a constant value, without a strain increment.
Extruded tendon
Tendons with CSi > ICS1 and CSi > ICS2 are calculated with their steel area into the com-
pound and with a deductional area of the same size. ICS1=ICS2=0 defines tendons with
immediate bond. These tendons are always active.
Inthefollowingfictitiousconstructionstageprogressions,theappropriatecharacteristicvalues
are suggested. Assignment of the load cases to these sections is naturally left up to the user:
1.1. Prestressed concrete girder with later bond
Tendon ICS1=0, ICS2=1
Sections CS0=0 Net cross section
CS1=1 Ideal cross section
2.1. Prefabricated, prestressed concrete part with stranded wires in
immediate bond
2.2. On-site concrete completion with material 2

on-site poured concrete
Tendon in immediate bond

Tendon in bond
3.1. Prefabricated, prestressed concrete part with stranded wires (0)
in immediate bond
3.2. Building-in of additional tendons (11) with later bond in prefabricated
part production
3.3. Poured concrete completion at the construction site and building-in of an
SOFiSTiK2023 3-41AQB|DescriptionofInput
additional tendon (21)
Strands ICS1=0, ICS2=0
Tendon (1) ICS1=11, ICS2=12
Tendon (2) ICS1=21, ICS2=22
Sections CS0=10 Prefab part w/o site concrete
Strands in immediate bond
Tendon (1) as a hole
Tendon (2) as a hole
CS1=11 Prefab part w/o site concrete
before first tendon in bond
CS2=12 Prefab part w/o site concrete
Strands in immediate bond
Tendon (1) in bond
Tendon (2) as hole
CS3=21 Prefab + insitu concrete
before second tendon in bond
CS4=22 Prefab + insitu concrete
All tendons in bond
These properties can also be defined in different ways, so that the user can hold to a method-
ology which suits him in large systems with many stages of construction progress. The order
in which tendons are considered depends only on the relative positions of the ICS numbers
with respect to the CS numbers.
Always the highest used CS number of the load cases will be employed for calculations at
the total section (e.g. nonlinear, creep and shrinkage etc.) Checks for building stages should
therefore be checked or include the CS value as specification at COMB. Forces and primary
strains will be converted to the selected reference if necessary.
Definition of the prestressing sequences CSi:
The stress of tendons is active only for those cases where the tendons are really active. This
is rather complex as the forces from prestress are acting on the section just before the one
where they enter. For the definition of the prestressing sequences CSi following points are to
be considered therefore:
• It is strongly recommended to supply two construction stage numbers for any post-
tensioning stage, one for the section, the post-stress is acting on. the second for the
grouted section with bond. It is also expected that for post-stressing the numbers ICS1
are lower than ICS2. See TEND
• The default for the CS-section of a combination is now derived from the load cases used
in that combination. (This might have an severe impact on those cases, where the desired
section type is not addressed by any load case for EIGE, ULTI or NSTR.)
3-42 SOFiSTiK2023DescriptionofInput |AQB
• If a tendon is not yet used in a CS-section, it will not have its initial stress value. If it is
included,thereisstillthefactorofprestresseffectiveespeciallyfortheveryfirstconstruction
phase.
3.8.3 Specification of reinforcements
BEAM may be also used to specify a discrete reinforcement pattern for a system as needed
for non-linear analysis or the determination of relative bearing capacities. When selecting the
beams by number and x-value you may specify at CS the literals AS for the longitudinal rein-
forcement or ASV for the shear links. At Position CSi you may now enter the reinforcement
valuesinAS[mm2] 1020 respASV[mm2/m] 1021 forthelayersofreinforcementwiththenum-
ber i. Instead of a value a name of a variable (with up to 8 characters) may be specified. This
variable must have the appropiate unit, but it may be defined also along an axis. As a further
enhancement, missing x-values will be interpolated.
BEAM SLN 1 X 0 XE 5 CS AS CS1 5 [cm2]

It has to be noted, that for accounting the existing reinforcements for the sectional values with
STRE and EIGE, the intended reinforcement distribution case LCR has to be selected with

Tendons are generally defined with the program TENDON. For special cases and especially
externalsections,however,theycanalsobespecifieddirectly. Thetendonsneedtobeentered
in order by beams and beam sections. The x values need to be specified with a precision of 1
mm. A use of this feature combined with forces directly defined with record S in load case 0 is
notpossible. (Seeexample aqb2_3_t-beam-bridgesection.datand aqb2_4_precastbeam.dat)
Thestressphasesarethenumbersoftimestagesintheprogressofaconstructionstage,and
areassignedtoindividualsectionsduringtheCSinputsoftheBEAMrecord. Fortendonswith
immediate bond, the correct specification is ICS2 0. For tendond without bond, the correct
specification is ICS2 NONE or ICS2 9999, For post tensioning i.e. tendons with a delayed
extrusion it is strongly suggested to specify ICS2 > ICS1.

3-44 SOFiSTiK2023DescriptionofInput |AQB
For the shear check it is necessary that the tendons lie within the cross section. Otherwise
the proportional tensile force is computed wrongly. It is not therefore possible to combine
all tendons into one single one which lies then outside of the cross section. AQB checks the
situationofthetendonwithatolerancewhichcorrespondstotheradiusoftheprestressedsteel
area. External tendons without bond that are supposed to be excluded from this examination
must be defined with ICS2 9999.
The values DZ and UZ are preset to the corresponding values of an individual beam. For UZ,
the literal BUND can be used to call the formula
(cid:112)
U = 1.6 · π · AZ (3.1)
If AR is defined as positive, then an additional calculation of the crack width is done for this
tendon alone. For this design, tension members are calculated into the total reinforcement
with the factor min(1.0,0.09/AR). This is to satisfy the requirement that tension members with
delayed bond can only be calculated within a square with sides of 30 cm. AR can be input as
anegativevalue, ifonlytheamounttobecalculatedisdesired. Ifindividualtendonsarenotto
be calculated in or designed at all for the crack width, then AR should be defined with a large
negative value.
NY and NZ are the corresponding inclinations of the prestress cable in respect to the axis of
the beam (tangent) :
NY =dY/dX
(3.2)
NZ=dZ/dX
Hint:
Older versions of AQB used only m as basic unit for this record. This has been changed
from Version 12.47 to the more common unit mm (or others selected via PAGE UNII) as within
TENDON. Old definitions will be flagged with an error 13 or 14.

LC is used to select the load cases to be designed. The first item NO may be specified with
a number, an expression with wildcard symbol (eg. "‘1??00"’) for load case numbers or the
name of a load case type (action). In the latter cases all load cases matching the criteria will
be selected. Especially interesting are:
(D) Ultimate Design combination
(A) Ultimate Accidental combination
(E) Ultimate Earthquake combination

(MT) middle term load combination e.g. for timber
(ST) short term load combination e.g. for timber
(VT) very short term load combination e.g. for timber
The load type is the name of the action to which the load case belongs. The default are the
already defined values, but it is possible to redefine all properties temporarily.
The most important actions are predefined with the INI-file of the design code. Further it is
possible to subdivide each action in categories selected with a character from A to Z, each
having distinguished combination coefficients or safety factors. This will be appended with an
underscore to the name of the action.
However 48 reserved names with designated meanings are used to trigger special effects in
AQB for historical superpositions. AQB saves results in the data base of the design for all
combinations (COMB) with an explicit LCST given and for all single load cases with one of the
above types assigned. If a load case should be classified only temporarily the type (-) may be
used.

TITL can be used not only to title a load case which is to be newly defined, but can also make
a later change or expand the name of a load case which is stored in the database.
Note:
Prestressing is only taken into consideration when a load case with that type of action is se-
lected. The factor in the combination will be also applied to the tension force itself if the action
does not have a category. With category 0 or 1 these define the factor for pre-tensioning
or post-tensioning only. Beside this the factor max not be specified differently, only the first
definition is taken.
Whendesigningindividualloadcaseswithprestressing,therefore,allloadcasesmustbegiven

For the check STRE U according the "‘Nachrechnungsrichtline"’ we have reduction factors r cp
derived from the shear links provided. They will be applied as additional factors.
With a definition of FAT DIN the sectional forces of this load case will be magnified based on
thelocationofthesectionwithafactorbetween1.40and1.75accordingtoparagraphA106.2
of DIN FB 102. Unfortunately the information about the start and the end of a span is hardly
defined. AQB will use the higher factors therefore only if the beam contains a section with the
attribute ”face” towards the respective end of the span.
Reference Points
The definition of the section type and reference is an essential input to calculate the stresses
with the appropriate section.
Withinthestaticanalysisallforcesshouldbereferencedtotheelasticcenteroftheappropriate
construction stage section as caclculated in AQUA. This is the point within a section where an
acting normal force will create only centric strains and thus no moments:
The association of the correct section type can be done either by a global construction stage
numberorbythesectiondesignationdefinedexplictlyintheBEAMrecord. ThedefaultforCST
isCS1forallloadcasetypesexceptG1andPR;forthesethedefaultisCS0. Loadcaseswith
undefined CS sections are assigned to the gross section. Therefore, when the CS values are
not defined in the BEAM record, all load cases operate on the gross section.

Using load cases
AQB has various ways of using load cases:
1. No specification for LC
If nothing is specified for LC, all load cases stored in the database are designed individu-
ally. External forces and moments S are processed separately as load case 0.
2. Specification for LC only
When LC is specified, only these load cases are designed.
3. LC and S
If internal forces and moments are defined after any LC record, they are saved under this
load case and are included in the remaining calculation. This option not only permits the
definition of load cases for sections, but also allows the inclusion of additional forces and
momentsinthecalculationforindividualsections,evenwithoutstaticdesigntoanexisting
system. This causes deletion of results stored under the same load case number.
4. LC and COMB
If design combinations are selected in addition, then only these combinations are de-
signed. The load case types are evaluated only in connection with these combination
regulations. The input of COMB supplements the possibilities of the program MAXIMA,
andallowscalculationwithdividedsafetycoefficients,orselectionfromamongtrafficload
cases.
The internal forces and moments of the load case, if any, must be input immediately following
the LC record. Internal stresses are automatically deleted when internal forces and moments
are input.
The combination coefficients and safety factors will be usually defined with the generation of
the load case. A definition in AQB will be only of temporarily influence and will not account for
any defaults by specifying a load case type. Only in those cases where forces and moments
are defined in AQB explicitly, the defaults from the corresponding INI-file will be taken.
The items APAR and SUP define the superposition of load cases within an action. The default
willbetakenfromtheaction. Howeverifonlyoneofthevaluesisspecified,theothervaluewill
be reset to its default value.

AQBS normally performs its design operations for the selected load cases. With COMB, com-
binationsoftheloadcasescanbedefinedinstead,asareusedinpartialsafetytheoryinmany
international codes or prestressed concrete.

haveextremevaluesfordifferenttargets,thustheloadcasesofthesametypearnowmutually
exclusive.
The combinations must be input before the particular design request is specified, and will stay
in effect for later operations as well, until a new definition is made.
For each combination you may define a load case number LCST to store results. Then the
results are stored under this load case number. These are:
• Combined forces and moments (not at EIGE) (incl. all special effects and transformations)
• Stresses for each material and selected stress points or the centre of every shear cut for
STRE. For shear stress in concrete we store for the reference stress the shear stress due
to lateral shear stress only.
• Eigenstresses in case of EIGE
• non-linear stresses for DESI and NSTR
You may also define for every block of combinations two special load case numbers via the
combinations GMAX and GMIN with LCST. Then the maximum and minimum values of the
results will be stored via this load case numbers in the same format.
If TITL is not selected, AQB constructs a name of its own from the involved load cases.

within the action definition. e.g:
• For the types G1, G2, P and C, all of the contributing components are added together
(permanent loads). Load type G includes all of the G1 and G2 load types.
• For the type Q, S, F all components will be added if their contribution is unfavourable (al-
ternate action). This is also valid for ZG, Z1, Z2, ZP, ZC, ZQ and SG, S1, S2, SP, SC,

Warning
The definition of an explicit factor will always overwrite any other default factor with-
out any reference on the type of superposition. Further the leading action will not be
selected automatically as within MAXIMA! AQB is designed to allow the build of explicit
combinations to find maximum reinforcements.
The ACI requires that these combinations to be investigated:
1.4 · G + 1.7 · L
1.05 · G + 1.275 · L + 1.43 · E
0.9 · G + 1.43 · E
With the use of appropriate factors, the superposition can also be defined according to max-
imum corner stresses. If the factor of the axial force is defined as 1.0, then the factors of the
moments are given by the ratio of area to moment of resistance.
Inthecaseofstructuralframes,forinstance,aloadcasewithalargeaxialforcemaybeleftout
of consideration in the maximum combinations of internal forces and moments, if its moment
proportion has a small effect or a favourable one. Here, those load cases which yield the
maximum value 1.0·MY0.15·N can be incorporated into the design. (The value 0.15 must be
selected appropriately for the section.) This can be accomplished with the input :
COMB EXTR MAX SCOM MY 1.0
COMB EXTR MAX SCOM N 0.15 LC1 G F1 1.0 LC2 L F2 1.0

With the use of appropriate factors, the superposition can also be defined according to max-
imum corner stresses. If the factor of the axial force is defined as 1.0, then the factors of the
moments are given by the ratio of area to moment of resistance.
These factors do not act on the forces of the combination itself. They will be considered only
to decide if a load case acts favourable or not. The seldom case where the factors act also on
the combination forces, can be accomplished through the input of the following EXTR values:
FSUM, FMAX, FMIN, FMAM, FSOL, FSMA, FSMI and FSMX

Certain additional moments may be specified according to the design codes. With the literal
MCR as load type there will be a minimum moment My, which yields a tension equal to the

With EIGE, redistributions of internal stresses are calculated. The parameters may be defined
separately for each material and group. The construction phase section which will be used for
the redistribution should be selected with COMB or LC. Without explicit definition, the section
will be selected following the highest used construction phase of the activated load cases.
(Accounting for creep after grouting of the tendon).
The most common case is the analysis of shrinkage and creep and tendon-relaxation, but
many other effects like non uniform temperature distributions may be handled as well.
The results are secondary strains and stresses in the section. They are stored under the load
case number of the individual load case, or under the load case number LCST of the record
COMB. These results are deleted, if internal forces and moments are defined with S for this
load case, or if new loads will be defined. The integral sectional forces may be added to the
external forces only informally.
The cross section for which the design should be computed can be defined in the record LC
for a single load case or with the COMB record. If this is not the case, then the the design is
always done with the section with the highest active construction stage. This default has to be
checked thoroughly for complex structures !
SOFiSTiK2023 3-59AQB|DescriptionofInput
If PHI or EPS is not defined, these values will be established based on the environment con-
ditions (humidity, temperature), the age of the concrete at time of loading, the cement class
and the effective thickness A/U. For these values AQB uses the design code associated to the
material and not that of the design task, because we need very specific material data for this.
However, one of the more general methods may be selected with CTRL EIGE.
For Bridges EN 1992-2 defines in section B.105 safety factors for delayed long term strains
to be used, "‘However, when safety would be increased by overestimation of delayed strains,
and when it is relevant in the project, the creep and shrinkage predicted on the basis of the
formulasorexperimentaldeterminationsshouldbemultipliedbyasafetyfactor."’Thustheuser
hastoselectthesefactorsviaadefinitionofCTRLEIGESAFE.TheprovisionsoftheGerman
NA to apply these factors always for the shrinkage is activated automatically if a bridge class
has been selected.
If T is defined, these basic values PHI and EPS will be modified according to the evolution in
time given by tables or formulas in the design codes. For those design codes relying on the
summation approach (DIN 4227, Japanese and Chinese Code) the delayed elasticity will be
incorporated automatically. If one wants to apply the time evolution function to be applied to
the explicit given PHI/EPS-values, one has to use a negative value for T. For the first creep
interval, the value T0 will control the age for the concrete for creeping and the amount of
shrinkage which has been occurred between TS and T0. If we need the total shrinkage (e.g.
for deformations or stresses with reinforcements) a separate unloaded shrinking time interval
has to be introduced.
The value of TEMP defines then either the temperature in Celsius (1 to 80 degree) during the
creepstepor,ifdefinednegativethetemperatureofathermaltreatmentbeforethecreepstep.
For special cases a definition with an explict unit − allows to specify an explicit scaling factor
for the effective age of the concrete.
The influence of the temperature on the tendon relaxation (EN 1992-1-1, 10.3.2.) should be
accounted for with an explicit Factor for PHI. The formula (10.2) given in EN 1992-1-1 is not
implemented as it yields for Tmax equal to 80 degrees a rapid (43.3 times accelerated) re-
laxation, so the method given in many technical papers to apply an immediate loss of 4% is
preferable. For very special cases a definition with increased time increment values according
to that formula can be specified.
ForanalysisSUMwithdelayedelasticity(oldDINandJapanandChina)thepartsfromdelayed
elasticity are always added if T is specified and applied for all primary creep results with the
corresponding negative value. The order of the load numbers must correspond to the chrono-
logical course in this case. Higher load case numbers must describe therefore later creep
stages. If the PHI value is given as 0.0, the part from delayed elasticity is suppressed. If one
wishes to determine only the re-creep, a small value must be entered at PHI.

depth, the environmental conditions and the concrete strength. Not included are temperature,
cements with other sulphate contents or high stresses. With a definition of EC at PHI a switch
to the Eurocode-Formulas may be achieved.
With the setting CTRL EIGE 1, curvature loads for calculating the statically indeterminate
shares from creep and shrinkage are stored. As a rule, multiple creep stages are required
in that case (e.g. 3 to 5) because STAR2/ASE do not know the stresses or the forces at
the end of an interval. If necessary, the relaxation parameters can be altered in AQB. If this
load case is not calculated with STAR2/ASE, the calculation for AQB remains unrestrained i.e.
statically determined.
If the centre of a part of a cross section has tensile stresses, the creeping coefficients are
reduced with the utilisation of this stress to the mean tensile strength. (See CTRL EIGE 32)
As a time dependent elasticity modulus is only to be used for loadings acting at that given
time. Allcreepdefomrationsarereferencedtothetangentmodulusattheageof28days. The
concrete itself has secant and tangential modulus defined, but as all the sectional values have
been established with secant values, the creep factors have to be modified accordingly. With
CTRL EIGE 512 this behavior may be deactivated.
EXP allows to select explicitly defined creep curves or coefficients defined with MEXT.

B: Evaluationoftheutilisationfactorsforeveryindividualcomponentandasimplified

C: Evaluation of the utilisation factors for every individual component and a complex

In all cases the elastic stress will be evaluated, as this is required to define a sectional class.
If the section is in class 3, the allowable stresses will be checked and their utilisation is save
to the data base as relevant utilisation. If the section is in class 1 or 2, the resistance of the
cross section for any individual force is calculated and for option P a simple linear addition of
all utilization degrees will be saved to the database as total utilisation, while option C will store
a complex interaction based on the provisions of the Eurocode (1993/1999).
Additional tables for every section if ECHO TABS has been set which is also the default value.

D: Suggested dimensions
Depending on the section class an estimate for the required dimensions of the
crosssectionismadebasedonallowablestressesorplasticsectionalcapacities.
For rectangle, circle, and steel shapes a rather detailed analysis is performed,
while for all other sections, a linear scaling factor for the dimensions factor is
evaluated. In the cases of rectangular sections, the width or height can be fixed
when defining the section. Option DE will use only the allowable stresses for the
dimensioning.
DG: SimilartooptionD.Howeversectionswillbeselectedfromagroupofsections. A
groupisdefinedviaasequenceofcrosssectionwithcontinuoussectionnumbers
and increasing load capacities. The first section of a group will differ only in the
last digit of the current section number. If sections with numbers 8,9,10,11 and
12 are defined, then the program may select instead of section 8 and 9 any of
thesenumberswhileforsections10,11and12onlythelastthreesectionswillbe
used. This Option is especially useful if one wants to select a different sequence
for British or American shapes (e.g. UC 305 x 305 x 97 before UC 254 x 254 x
132). Option DGE will use only the allowable stresses for the dimensioning.
STRE D / DG is not able in general to perform a final selection of the section as the change of
the section will yield other loads and forces and moments.
Stresses from the combinations are stored if LCST is specified in the record COMB. Without
COMB, the stresses of the individual load cases are saved, if they were specifically defined
with a design type (e.g. LC type (D)).
A literal can be entered for STYP. Then the safety factors and permissible stresses and any
special features of the defined materials and codes are preset. Explicit input of the limiting
stresses is now only necessary in special cases.
In all cases an additional global safety factor SCMG may be defined to be multiplied with the
SOFiSTiK2023 3-63AQB|DescriptionofInput
selected safety factors
A material number can also be specified for SMOD. In that case the permissible stresses
only for this material are defined differently. SMOD 0 describes the stresses of all materials.
However, this does not start the stress check itself. That has to be done with a later record
which has a normal input for SMOD.
The permissible stresses are set in the sequence of the records entered. All undefined ma-
terials are set to the values specified in the final STRE input. If STRE is activated more than
once, all material definitions must be entered before the corresponding STRE record. STRE
only with the material number causes a calculation of the stresses with the option E.
For steel and aluminum a literal from the following table can be input. Then the values with
[N/mm2] are set accordingly.

Design checks are always based on stresses, thus if we have differentv allowable stresses for

stresses will be checked only for the outer borders of the cross section. For torsional stresses
in the middle area as it will occur for a boxed section the torsional stress is limited to the TAU
value as it is also used for the shear force.
Design according to EN 1995 or DIN 1052-2008 combines the bending stress of My and Mz
via a special combination factor. Further there are reductions of the compressive strength and

3.14.1 Shear Design- STRE UL
Some design codes allow a design for shear of concrete sections based in an uncracked
model. ThesearetheoldGermanDIN4227orthefirstamendmenttotheGerman"‘Nachrech-
nungsrichtlinie"’ of the German Ministry of Transport (2015). In all cases the stress at the
extreme fiber of the section is not allowed to exceed a certain value.
For the latter the definition of STRE U has to be selected. As in the
"‘Nachrechnungsrichtlinie"’ the allowable stresses depend on the existence of flanges
in the tensile zone and the provided shear links, AQB checks the center of all shear cuts for
flanges to decide which value is to be taken for the values SBZ and SI. ECHO SHEA YES will
SOFiSTiK2023 3-67AQB|DescriptionofInput
print only the maximum values and the obtained limit values. With ECHO SHEA FULL, the
shear cuts are printed for those sections fulfilling the longitudinal stress limit, wit ECHO SHEA
EXTR all shear cuts will be printed.
For DIN 4227 the input of define STRE E UL does not only start the design of the stresses in
Zonea,butalsothelimitingstressesforsheardesignundercrackedconditioninZonebusing
DESI. For this reason, the meanings of some values have been changed. Here the values
TAU,SVandTAUSstandforvaluesfromTable9,lines56,59and61,andthevaluesSSTMto
SSKR stand for the values from lines 53, 50, 54, 52, and 55. So a design is done when one of
the shear stress or principal tensile stress components exceeds the following limits:
τ V > SSEM
or τ T > SSTM or SSER
or τ V+T > SSKM or SSKR
As the value SSEM is also used for the specification of the inclination of the truss model, a full
shear analysis should be triggered by specifying SSKR 0.001.
The base values for shear stress for phase 2 require
τ V < TAU
and τ T < SV
and τ V+T < TAUS
and σ  < CC (Webs) resp. CBC (Flanges)
If no record STRE has been defined with ULnn, the entire shear design is done by DESI in
cracked conditions. Otherwise a differentiation is made between Zones a and b depending
upon the maximum uniaxial extreme fibre stress LIMA, and only sections in Zone b are de-
signed. For the stresses found with STRE, transitions of the limits are noted only in Zone a.
SpecificationofGRZA0willperformbothtypesofdesign,usingthespecifiedstresslimits,but
the required reinforcement is taken only from the design for zone b.
3.14.2 Minimum Reinforcement - STRE RL
With STRE E RL the check can be selected according to 7.3.2 EN 1992-1 or 11.2.2. of DIN
1045-1resp. 6.7.3ofDIN4227-A1. Thedesignmaybeperformedforeithersideofthesection
as well as for individual parts of the section selected with a CUT-definition within AQUA.
The volume of the tensile stresses is evaluated for the design combination which yields the
tensile strength of the concrete. From that a required reinforcement is evaluated, which is
covered with the defined reinforcement layers and a reduced area of the tendons. Item SC is
used for the crack width in mm according to Table 20 (default 0.3), ST may be used to specify
afactorkexplicitly,forSBTanexplicitvalueforthetensilestrengthorafactorwithUnit[-]may
be specified. LIMA is the limit value of the tensile stresses (default -1 N/mm2). The distinction
between the two formulas 7.2 and. 7.3 for the evaluation of k_c requires an intelligence not
available in AQB. AQB considers the ratio between the area of the tensile zone to the product
of the height of the tensile zone and the minimum web thickness to interpolate between the
two formulas.

With record BEAM it is possible to specify an existing layout of reinforcements which can be

SUPE cannot be used during an iteration, since then the maximum reinforcement for an itera-

Astheexistingreinforcementhasaconsiderableimpactonthesheardesign,AQBwillperform
an intermediate superposition after the design for normal force and bending moments. How-
ever, use of minimum reinforcement in ultimate load design has also a detrimental effect on
3-70 SOFiSTiK2023DescriptionofInput |AQB
the shear reinforcement, since the lever of internal forces is reduced. The user can take the
appropriate precautions by specifying a minimum lever arm in AQUA.
Since this latter effect is especially strong with tendons, AQBS can give special effect to the
latter in ultimate load design. This option is controlled with ZGRP:
ZGRP = 0 Tendons are considered with both their area and their prestressing. Normal
reinforcement is specified at the minimum percentage.
The relative loading capacity is found.
ZGRP > 0 Tendons are specified with their full prestressing, but with their area (stress
increase) only in so far as necessary. Normal reinforcement is installed only
if the prestressing steel alone is not sufficient.
A required area of prestressing steel is determined.
ZGRP < 0 Tendons are applied with their prestressing, only in so far as necessary, oth-
erwise the same like ZGRP > 0.
If ZGRP < > 0 has been specified, the tendons are grouped into tendon groups. The group is
calculatedbytheintegerpartfromdividingtheidentificationnumberofthetendonbyZGRP.For
the printout the groups are identified by characters to distinguish them from the reinforcement
layers. Group"‘P"’containsthetotalareaandtheprestressforcesonly,group’Z’isthegroup0

Anygroupnumberhigherthan4isassignedtogroup"‘D"’. Theuseofdifferentsteelmaterials
in the same group may lead to slightly inconsistent results and will be flagged with a warning.
Assume that tendons with the numbers 1,11,12,21,22 and 101 have been defined. With the
appropriate inputs for ZGRP, the following division is obtained:
ZGRP 0 All tendons are minimum reinforcement
ZGRP 10 Tendon 1 is group Z and minimum reinforcement
Tendons 11 and 12 are group A and optional
Tendons 21 and 22 are group B and optional
Tendon 101 is group D and optional
ZGRP 100 Tendons 1,11,12,21 and 22 are group Z and minimum reinforcement
Tendon 101 is group A and optional
An example of the effect can be found in Section 5.1.6.3.
Notes: Parameters for determining reinforcement
The following parameters are not to be changed by the user in general:
Default Typical
P7 Weighting factor of moments 5 0.5 - 50
P8 Weighting factor dimensions -2 -2
When designing, the strain plane is iterated by the BFGS method.
Lack of convergence in the design with biaxial loading can generally be attributed to the
factors no longer shaping the problem convexly, so that there are multiple solutions or
none. In these cases the user may change the value of P7. In most cases, however,

Design may be performed for various safety concepts and loading conditions specified with
STAT. The definition of the loading condition selects the predefined safety factors and appro-
priate stress strain laws defined via the INI file for the active design code.
When designing for ultimate load or combinations with splitted safety factors, the load factor
must be already contained in the internal forces and moments. One way to accomplish this is
with the COMB records.

The safety factors will be preset dependent on the load condition from the INI-definition as
well. The values might be overwritten with the items SC1 to SS0. Either with an explicit value
or as factor (e.g. 0.9[−]) Safety factors <1.0 (American and Australian codes) will be used as
factors on the resistance.
Thus we have the following cases:
• without the D safeties defined with the material will be ignored.
• with a D and a safety factor of 1.0 the safety factors defined with the material will be used.
Thisoptionisrequiredforthosecaseswherereinforcementshavedifferentsafetyfactorfor

• with a D and positive safety factors these factors will be applied globaly. This option allows
to account for strain dependant safet y factors as used in the ACI or the old DIN
• with a begative safety factor this value will be used additionally for the resistance.
PL resp. PLD will modify for some design codes (DIN, EC, ACI) the stress strain law to a
constant equivalent stress block, i.e. the stress value and the strain range will be modified
according to the provisions of those codes.
With the special definition of SS1 NRIL the safety factors of the reinforcements will be set to
1.05 and 1.10 according to the provisions of the German ”Nachrechnungsrichtlinie”, also the
ordinates of those reinforcements will be reduced then by an offset of 20 resp. 10 m.

of the section area.
The value AM4 is a direct factor for the Formulas 9.5.2 resp. 9.6.2 of EN 1992-1-1. A positive
value will be applied for columns and walls, while a negative value is used only for columns.
The relevant value is the maximum of the minimum reinforcements:
- Absolute minimum reinforcement (AM1/AM2)
- Minimum reinforcement of statically required section
- Minimum reinforcement defined in cross section program AQUA
- Minimum reinforcement stored in the database

design will always generate both bending axis. The output of the extra moments is given with
the forces of the combinations.
Defaults for strain limits and safety coefficients depend on the selected design code and the
type of load combination. They may be specified in the INI-file of the design code. If SC1 and
SC2aredefineddifferent(e.g. oldDIN1045,ACI),thenthesafetyfactorsofthereinforcements
will be also interpolated if SS1 is equal to SC1.
The maximum strain depends on the stress-strain curve. The value of 2.2 is reduced for ex-
ample at the old DIN or high strength concrete automatically. The EN (6.1.(5)) and the DIN
suggest to limit the strain also for the midpoint of compressive flanges. This option may be
selected by defining a value of C2 as positive (to select) or negative (to disable) the control.
The strain is then limited that the value of C2 is not exceeded in any center of a shear cut with
the property "flange".
ThevaluesZ1andZ2donotlimittherangeofpossiblestrains,butlimitthestresstothevalue
which is reached for the total strain Z1 or the strain increment Z2 from the stress-strain law for

necessary, when designing with partial prestressing under DIN 4227 Part 2. A specification of
0.0 will deactivate the limit. A stress-strain law without hardening will not be effected.
According to EN 1992 5.5 (4) or DIN 1045-1 8.2/8.3 (3) the height of the compressive zone
should be limited to achieve a certain ductility. (e.g. not larger than 0.45 d, or 0.35 d for high
strength concrete). As the maximum compressive strain is fixed (3.5 o/oo), this is equivalent
to the request that the steel strain has at least a value of S1 (4.278 for x/d=0.45). If this is not
fulfilled a compressive reinforcement is needed and a minimum shear link according to DIN
1045-1 13.1.1. (5) has to be provided. A negative definition of S1 either explicitly or via the
INI-file will define the value of S1 depending on the strength of the concrete, the ductility and
the required degree of redistribution δ = DELR.
AnequivalentformulationisgiveninOENORM4700,whereitisrequestedthatthesteelshould
reach the yield strength. AQB fulfills also a more general rule, that the compressive reinforce-
ment is not allowed with a larger value than the tensile reinforcement. Thus AQB provides
symmetricreinforcementsforalldesigncodeswhenthesteelstraindoesnotexceedthevalue
of S1, fulfilling the request for ductility in that way.
This design operation is also suitable for non-reinforced sections. In that case the program
produces internal forces and moments which are in the same proportion to each other as the
external forces and moments. The safety factors SC1 and SC2 have to be defined dependent
on the design code. The program then shows the relative load carrying capacity and prints a
warning if this should fall below 1.0.
The shear design finds the lever of internal forces for all load cases with compression and

shearing force and torsion. The shear stress limits are set automatically depending on SMOD
and the material. Deviating values for the shear stress limits can be defined within AQB with a
record STRE (under 4227 only) or TVS. Since in case of excess of the shear stress limits no
designmoreoccurs,thiscanbeexceededontoownresponsibilityoftheuserwithatolerance.
For the reduction of the shear capacity for tensile members the normal stress σ pc is limited to
the value MSCD. The default is selected with the mean tensile strength fctm.
Theinclinationofthestrutsinthetrussmodelisspecifiedinthedesigncodes. Thelimitvalues
are specified in the INI-files of the design codes and may be increased by a TVAR definition.
Available are upper an lower limits for the tangent of web (TANMIN,TANMAX), compressive
flanges (TANMINC,TANMAXC) and tensile flanges (TANMINT,TANMAXT). The lower values
may be also increased by an explicit value with every shear cut. The min and max values
TANA and TANB in this record should not be used. Thus the applied minimum inclination is
always the maximum from all definitions.
For the torsion the same angle is used in general, but for some design codes and for contrary
shear there are deviations.
Thelongitudinalforcesortheconsiderationoftheshiftruleoftheenvelopeofthetensileforces
depend upon the CTRL option VM. It is possible to specify explicit values for the inclination for
transverse shear and torsion. Then the longitudinal forces of the truss model will be evaluated
beforehand and considered in the bending design directly. While the value for the transverse
shear increases the minimum value only, the value for the torsion will be always applied.
The ratio Ved/Vrd,max and the value of the shift will be saved to the database.
If a section is to be considered as a plate has already been defined with the section itself. The
definition of KTAU is thus only effective for those sections.

printed, if the resistance is not sufficient.

• If the yield strength is not reached, the section will be checked against the slenderness of

• Is the section classifed as class 4, the non effective parts according EN 1993-1-5 will be
calculated and taken into account.
3.17.2 Design for Reinforced Concrete
To calculate the correct strain condition, knowledge of the actual existing reinforcement is
needed. If the latter was not defined in AQUA as the minimum reinforcement or with BEAM
as current reinforcement, then an appropriate DESI record needs to have been calculated in
advance. The most recently determined distribution of reinforcements for each case is saved
in the database. This is not valid, however, for internal forces and moments of the load case 0
!
Specifying a value for CRAC will perform a check of the crack width and/or the limit diameter
withthediametersanddistancesdefinedinAQUAandpossiblereferenceareas. Nonspecified
distances are calculated for a linear reinforcement based on the total area and the specified
diameter, but not larger than the maximum allowed value taken from the INI-file. If required,
AQB will try to fulfill the requirements by an increase of the provided reinforcements, unless
CTRL REIN FIX/FIXL has been specified.
TheparameterCWisinnearlyallcasesthenecessarycrackwidth(wk,cal)andwillbepreset
accordingly. The utilisation factor for the crack width is the ratio of the achieved crack width
to the requested value. If CW is defined as 999 the increase of the reinforcements will be
deactivated and the utilisation factor is the absolute crack width.

OEN 4700 (Tables 8 to 10)
SIA 262-2017 (Equation 100a)
BAEL (Material only), AS 5100, Egyptian design code
In all cases it is possible to specify a direct admissable stress value with SIGS.
EN 1992 / DIN 1045 / B 4700:
CW is the necessary crack width (wk, cal), with a default of 0.2 mm. The reduced values for
restraining loading of thick cross sections under EC 2 must be converted by the user (e.g. by
wk = 1.3/1.7 · 0.2 = 0.15). The item BB has to be specified as 0.5 for long term and 1.0
SOFiSTiK2023 3-81AQB|DescriptionofInput
for short term actions. Other coefficients will be derived from that value, e.g. EN 1992 kt =
0.2+0.4 · BB.
If FFCT is not given explicitly a minimum value of 3 MPa is assumed in Germany as mean
tensile strength.
DIN 1045-1 does not need any other factors for the crack width itself. For non-linear methods
including Tension Stiffening however formulas are given in Paper 525 of DAfStB section 8.5
(page 36), BB is used to specify the value β t.

190.2). The printout will show either the concrete stress with a preceeding ”c” or the tendon
stress with a preceeding ”t”.

SNIP 2.03.01:
For the design you have to select a crack width. The calculation of the crack width is done for
the completed crack pattern according to equation 8.128. The input value BB is used for an
explicit parameter ϕ 1, default is 1.4.
EHE:
This Spanish design code is rather similar to the Eurocode (BB is factor k2). It classifies four
possible crack width values (0.40, 0.30, 0.20 and 0.10 mm). But then then formulas for the
effective height and the crack distance and the mean strain quite different. Thus there is no
dependency on the bond properties of the reinforcements. The distance of the longitudinal
bars is always taken as 15 ∅, because we have not enough information available for more
details. Tension stiffening is treated as with EC 2.

The default value for hh is 100 mm, but the INI-file may contain a formula. The strain in these
critical points will be printed and saved to the database.
3.17.3 Iteration Methods
Calculation of non-linear stiffnesses in AQB with other values than S0 is successful only if
another program like ASE, STAR2 or DYNA is called again with a new iteration as a restart,
and this process is repeated until convergence occurs. Thus it is recommended to define
these records within ASE or STAR2 and to define the number of iterations there. Within the
procedure WPS/SPS it is possible to call several programs in turn with the option PROG ITER
which is optimized however for the use with STAR2 (cf. AQB 5.2.2. prefabricated column).
An analysis of unloading or the hysteresis of load cycles is not possible today for beam ele-
ments!
Selection of the optimum iteration method is not easy, because the selected type of stiffness
update determines the iteration and convergence behaviour. In most cases the use of KMOD
S1 or SN will be straight forward. KMOD SN is the fastest method for slightly nonlinear prob-
lems, while S1 is suited for highly loaded systems where it may happen that the ultimate load
capacity of a section is exceeded within an iteration step. For the methods K0, K1 or KN the
stiffness will be kept constant, but plastic strains are calculated, to be used as extra loading
as initial strains similar to a temperature loading. Using this approach the failure of the system
is no longer given by an instability detected during the solution of the equation system, but by
monotone increasing deformations, which have to be checked carefully therefore.
The user should start with SN for lightly loaded systems and with S1 for more heavily loaded
systems,andshouldthenshifttoK1orK0ifnecessary. Whentherearemanysimilarsystems,
it pays to find the optimum method by experimentation.
To prevent endangering the iteration procedure, only changes of stiffness of a certain magni-
tudearepermitted. Avalueof0.4forALPHmeansthatineachstepthestiffnesscandecrease
at most to 0.4 times its last value, or increase at most to 1/0.4 times its last value. ALPH is
preset to 0.4 in ASE / STAR2, but to 0.01 in AQB itself. Independently of that, the stiffnesses
SOFiSTiK2023 3-83AQB|DescriptionofInput
remain limited to the range between KMIN and KMAX, referenced to the elastic stiffness.
With critical systems, which exceed their loading capacity in the course of the iteration, it may
be necessary to limit the maximum acceleration factor with FMAX. A value of less than 1.0
damps the iteration procedure. A value of 0.0 turns the procedure off. The default of FMAX is
2.0 at a calculation with NSTR KMOD SN and CTRL INTE 4.
3.17.4 Fatigue / Stress Range
Forcouplingjointsandotherconstructionsitmayberequiredtodesignforfatiguewithagiven
stress range. This can be easily accounted for by defining several load cases for the same
section. If the fatigue check needs also the permanent stress, you should include one load
case of type MAXP in the analysis. To save the stress range in the database an extra load
case number is required to be specified via COMB GMAX LCST ...
AQB will keep track of maximum and minimum stresses and will compare the resulting differ-
encewiththethresholdvaluesspecifiedforconcreteandreinforcingsteelinAQUA.Sogener-
ally the allowed stress range should be specified at the material definition. For the simplified
check acc. EN 1992-1-1 6.8.6 it is also possible to explicitly set an allowed stress range (e.g.
70 MPa) with the option SIGS. This value is effective for all reinforcement materials. However
such a global definition will deactivate some specific stress modifications of the design codes.
Unless a definition of CTRL REIN FIX/FIXL has been specified, AQB will increase the area of
passive reinforcements accordingly, if the limit value for the reinforcements is exceeded. But
there will be no reanalysis of the load cases with the changed values. All printed results are
therefore valid for the reinforcement before the analysis. Special notice should be given to the
fact, that without a preliminary design only the minimum reinforcements for longitudinal and
shear links are used.
For the fatigue design check according to DIN 1045-1 resp. DIN FB-102 the Literal FAT DINF
should be entered, further definitions might be done with records LC and BEAM or within the
material definition (AQUA).
It might be helpful to increase the volume of print out via ECHO NSTR EXTR in such cases.

These records allow to create single values or diagrams of sectional capacities.
Forces and moments may be defined as true values, as factors [-] on the single value capac-
ity. Alternatively strains with the explicit unit [o/oo] may be defined. Curvatures have to be
defined as difference of strains across the section height. Distortions are refered to the unit
GEO_LENGTH[1001].
Reinforcements may be specified explicitly in [cm2] or as factors [-] on the values defined in
the section.
3.18.1 STR single values
All forces will be converted to corresponding elastic strains. Then the non linear normal and
shearstresseswillbeevaluatedbasedonthesuperpositionofallstrainsandintegratedtototal
forces and moments.
3.18.2 MC moment-curvature relations
The task STR will be evaluated for a set of strains and presented graphically. The curvatures
ky and kz will be scaled simultaneously from 0 to the maximum value of MY and MZ. All other
strains will be unchanged. However, if N is defined as force, an iteration of the central strain
will be done, to match these normal force. (See S1/K1 in record NSTR).
The maximum strains will be controlled if any design state is selected, and exceedence of the
limit strains will be flagged.
3.18.3 NM interaction of normal force with moments
The task STR will be evaluated for a set of limit strains and presented graphically. The central
strainandthecurvatureswillbeselectedbasedonthedesigncodelimitstrainsandtheratioof
kyandkz. Allotherstrainswillbeunchanged. However,ifMYandMZaregivenasforcesand
biaxial bending ist active, an iteration of the orientation of the neutral axis will be performed to
give a planar meridian cut of the interaction surface.

3.19.1 Output masks)
All elements (parts) of a cross section are marked from program AQUA with a literal with up to
4 characters. The output of selected values (polygon points, reinforcement etc.) contains only
the elements which match any defined mask SELE. Multiple SELE definitions for every option
are possible.
SELE is a literal with up to 4 characters which may contain wildcard-symbols. These are:
’*’ for any number of any characters
’?’ for any character
for example the literal
’A*’ includes all words who start with A
’?0’ includes all words with two characters with second character ’0’
’1??0’ includesallwordswith4characterswithfirstcharacter’1’andlastcharacter
’0’
’*’ can be any word
’*A’ or any other with any character after ’*’ are equivalent to the literal up to ’*’.
