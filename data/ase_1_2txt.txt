1 Task Description
ASE calculates the static and dynamic effects of general loading on any type of structure. To
startthecalculationstheuserdividesthestructuretobeanalyzedintoanassemblyofindividual
elements interconnected at nodes (Finite Element Method). Possible types of elements are
: haunched beams, springs, cables, truss elements, plane triangular or quadrilateral shell
elements and three-dimensional continuum elements.
The program handles structures with rigid or elastic types of support. An elastic support can
be applied to an area, a line or at nodal points. Rigid elements or skew supports can be taken
into account.
ASE calculates the effects of nodal, line and block loads. The loads can be defined indepen-
dently from the selected element mesh. The generation of loads from stresses of a primary
load case allows the consideration of construction stages, redistribution and creep effects.
Non-linearcalculationsenablestheusertotakethefailureofparticularelementsintoaccount,
such as: cables in compression, uplifting of supported plates, yielding, friction or crack effects
for spring and foundation elements. Non-linear materials are available for three-dimensional
and shell elements. Geometrical non-linear computations allow the investigation of 2nd and
3rd order theory effects by cable, beam, shell and volume structures.
In case of beam structures, the program can calculate warping torsion with up to 7 degrees of
freedom per node.
The user of ASE should therefore gather experience from simple examples before tackling
more complicated structures. A check of the results through approximate engineering calcula-
tions is imperative.
The basic version of ASE performs the linear analyses of beams, cables, trusses, plane and
volume structures. Plain strain and rotational systems can be analyzed with TALPA.

2 Theoretical Principles
2.1 General
A continuum or a plane structure can be interpreted as a statically or geometrically infinitely
indeterminate structure. If an analytical solution is unknown, every numerically approximate
methodisbasedonconvertingthisinfinitesystemintoafiniteone,inotherwordstodiscretizing
it.
The advantage of the finite elements lies in their universal applicability to any geometrical
shape and almost to any loading. This is achieved by a modular principle. Single elements
which describe parts of the structure in a computer oriented manner are assembled into a
complete structure.
The continuous structure is represented thus by a large but finite number of elements. A
discrete solution consisting of n unknowns is calculated instead of the continuous solution. In
general,theapproximatesolutionmayrepresenttheexactsolutionbetterwiththeuseofmore
elements. Thesingleelementsofanareacanbeofarbitrarilysmalldimensionsincomparison
to the dimensions of the overall structure without giving rise to any incompatibilities with the
presentedtheory. Therefinementofthesubdivisionis,however,subjectedtocertainlimitations
due to numerical reasons.
The Finite Element Method (FEM) employed in ASE is a displacement method, meaning that
theunknownsaredeformationvaluesatseveralselectedpoints,theso-callednodes. Displace-
mentscanbeobtainedwithanelement-wiseinterpolationofthenodalvalues. Thecalculation
of the mechanical behaviour is based generally on an energy principle (minimisation of the
deformation work). The result is a so-called stiffness matrix. This matrix specifies the reaction
forces at the nodes of an element when these nodes are subjected to known displacements.
The global force equilibrium is generated then for each node in order to determine the un-
knowns. A force in the same direction which is a function of this or another displacement
corresponds to each displacement. This leads to a system of equations with n unknowns,
where n can become very large. Numerically beneficial banded matrices result, however, due
to the local character of the element-wise interpolation.
The complete method is divided into four main parts:
1. Determination of the element stiffness matrices.
2. Assembly of the global stiffness matrix and solution of the resulting equation system
3. Application of loads and determination of the corresponding displacements.
4. Determination of the element stresses and support reactions due to the computed dis-
placements.
ThesecondstepisthatwithmostCPUtime. Itmayuseupto90percentofthetotalCPUtime.
However, it has to occur only once for a static system.
The stresses jumps from element to element. The size of the jump is thus a direct measure of
the quality of the FE analysis.

2.3 Beam Elements
The beam element in ASE is an arbitrary haunched beam element including shear deforma-
tions and hinge effects. It can be defined also eccentrically to the node connecting line. For
haunched cross sections in bridge analysis all nodes can be defined on the top face of the
superstructure.
2.3.1 Geometric nonlinear Theory 2nd and 3rd Order
The following figures shall clarify the essential characteristics between SOFiSTiK theory 2nd
and 3rd order (TH2 and TH3).

deflectionduxinxdirection(noduz!). Thebeamcangetlongerthanintheoriginalshape. The
bottom bending moment increases due to the displacement of the vertical load Pz. This type
of analysis is also known as pi-delta method.
In the complete geometric nonlinear analysis TH3 the column head follows the physically cor-
rect path. Equilibrium is iterated on the real deformed shape.
In figure 2.3 a horizontally fixed bending girder is loaded vertically. In TH2 the girder just

Figure2.2: girderleft+rightfixedinx! : TH3inducesaloadcarryingnormalforceN
In the TH3 analysis the vertical displacement causes a lengthing of the beam. The created
normal force N carries a part of the load and reduces the vertical deformation.
Examples see SYST
Only in TH3 on beam-, quad- and bric elements the rigid body motions are substracted from
the total displacements to get the stress inducing pure deformations:

2.3.2 Coordinate System of Forces, Center of Gravity
In TH2 the forces are related to the original coordinate system. So the shear forces are
transversal forces. In the column example in figure 2.1 N stays vertical and VZ stays hori-

Figure2.4: order
The beam forces N, MY and MZ are related to the center of gravity of the actual active partial
section (not to node connecting line). MT, VY and VZ are related to the center of shear.
Dead load is applied in the center of mass since version 2016. So an excentric dead load
(refered to the center of stiffness) is taken into account.
2.3.3 Warping torsion
Warping torsion can be used for straight beam structures with CTRL WARP 1.
Warping effects can also appear without warping support. In the following picture to example

applied in midspan of a single girder

output):
The total torsional moment Mt has 3 parts (MT= MTp +MTs +MTn):
MTp - primary torsional moment from Saint Venant shear stresses
MTs - secondary tors. moment (flange shear from warping longitudinal stresses)
MTn - theory 2. order torsional moment from twisted normal stresses
Mbwarpingmoment(fromwarpinglongitudinalstresses-createsMTsatotherbeamsections)
You can imagine the behavior as follows: the flange forces in midspan deflect the flanges
opposite and transport a part of the loading via longitudinal stresses to the support.
The longitudinal warping stress due to Mb in midspan create a flange shear force at the sup-
ports. The corresponding torsional momennt MTs at the support is about 0.05 kNm. At the
support itself, the longitudinal warping stresses are zero (free end) - see Mb = 0 kNm. The
effects are as follows:

The warping effects are also explained in warping_mtp_mts_mtn.dat. There the interaction of
MTs and Mb for a MT load on a cantilever is interpretet as follows:
• Please notice that at the cantlever end (beam 10 x= 0.4) already a part of the load MT=

2.3.4 SOFiSTiK - T-Beam Philosophy centric (for buildings)
See YOUTUBE Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoT1f0aGdgs
Automatic addition of the T-beam parts for FE plates with beams
Example see ase3_t_beam_test.dat
Figure2.6: T-BeamPhilosophy
Attention: This model can not be used for influence line evaluation with ELLA because ELLA
does not add the slab parts to the beam! This is only possible with the excentric T-Beam
philosophy with TBEX
A 2D slab analysis is usually sufficient and desirable for beams and continuous beams with
effective cross section widths in a slab. Only in a 2D slab analysis normal forces are not
determined in the slab or in the beam! The advantage is that the slab can be simply designed
(without normal forces) particularly for the shear checks. In addition the determined beam
moments can be designed directly with the right T-beam cross section.
Procedure: The user or the graphical input program positions a centric defined beam in the
node plane (with the T-beam cross section see picture on the right). The QUAD elements are
also defined centric. As the beam is positioned in the centre of gravity (a little bit below the
slabcenter),theupperedgeoftheT-beamlooksalittlebitoutoftheslab-thisisalsovisiblein
WinGRAF.TheANIMATORdisplacesthecrosssectionalittlebitdownwards,sothattheupper
edges beam+slab appear at the same position for a better visualization. So in the standard
casethebeamsectionisdefinedwiththecorrespondingeffectiveslabwidth. Lookingfromthe
side (see picture left below) you see that cross section parts and slab overlap and concrete
areas are defined twice. These double parts are now corrected in the T-Beam philosophy:
Thereforeinthestiffnessanalysistheslabpart(I-slab=bVh3/12withb=effectivewidth=width
of the cross section) is substracted automatically from the stiffness of the beam I-Tbeam. An
equivalent (reduced) beam is used:
2-6 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
I–equivalent beam = I–Tbeam – I–slab
In the same way the deadload of the equivalent beam is modified to avoid double dead load.
Then the program at first determines a bending moment of this equivalent beam in a FE anal-
ysis. Theinternal forcespartsoftheslab(M-slab=m-slab · b)areaddedautomaticallyimme-
diately. Thus the complete T-beam internal forces are available for the following beam design:
M–Tbeam = M–equivalent beam + M–slab
The bending moments My and the shear forces Vz are added as default, for shells also the
normal forces N. The torsional moment Mt is not added as default.
Output:
• The parts of the slab are already included in the printout of the beam forces.
• A statistic of the slab parts follows. The maximum slab parts are compared with the maxi-
mum beam internal forces:
Statistic Beam - Additional Forces from a Slab

min -48.60 0.00 -43.63 0.00
For safety the internal forces are not reduced in the FE plate elements, although it would be
possible about the amount of the increase of the beam internal forces. So this method can be
uneconomical for smaller beam heights.
Beams which are connected with kinematic constraints at the slab are also processed, if the
beams are positioned in the slab plane.
Defaults for the addition of the plate internal forces to the beam internal forces:
For slab structures:
• The single beam must have a cross section with a defined width at the start and the end.
A defined width can be generated from a T-beam (e.g. record SREC in AQUA) and from
general cross sections (e.g. AQUA record SECT and following). The maximum width of
the cross section is used in each case (independent of the position of the plate, above or
below). A cross section which is input without dimensions however with stiffnesses (e.g.
with record SVAL) does not known any defined width. A plate part can therefore not be
added for these beams!
• The single beam is connected generally directly with the nodes of the plate.
• After an automatic mesh generation or a free mesh definition the straight beam which
is positioned in the plate plane can be combined also with the FE mesh via kinematic
constraints.
• The beam reads the plate thickness and the modulus of elasticity from these plate nodes.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-7ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
Different plate thicknesses are possible at the beam start and end.
Additionally for three-dimensional slab structures (ASE):
The feature can be used also for three-dimensional slabs however with following restrictions:
• The beams must be positioned in the same plane as the plate. The plate parts are not
added for beams which are connected eccentrically.
Special features with the input:
• The beam cross section must represent the effective cross section, therefore the web and
theeffectiveplate. Ifaconcreteslabonasteelgirdershouldbeconsideredasacomposite
construction, the steel girder must be defined with the effective concrete plate as cross
section! The determined internal forces and moments refer then to this composite cross
section.
• The effective width (cross section width) should be chosen a little bit smaller than to large
especially over the columns, because for the plate moment to be added only the moment
near the node at which the beam and the plate are combined is used (see CTRL PLAB
V2). This plate moment is processed then unchangeable acting about the whole width.
The internal forces and moments are therefore not exactly integrated about the effective
width!
• TheplatestiffnessI-plate(withoutthepartofSteiner)isdivertedfromthetotalcrosssection
stiffness I-cross. If the subtrahend I-plate is bigger than 0.8·I-cross, a warning is printed
and the minimum stiffness of 0.2·I-cross is used.
• Forthree-dimensionalsystemsthesubtrahendismaximal0.9·A-crossfortheareaA-plate.
At least 0.1·A-cross are available then for the fictitious beam in the FE system.
Special features with the output:
• The attenuated stiffnesses are printed with ECHO PLAB FULL. If a cross section is avail-
able at beams with different plate thicknesses (e.g. haunches), the attenuated stiffness is
printed for the minimal and maximal plate thickness.
• The plate parts are already available in the printed beam internal forces and moments and
can be designed directly.
For comparison a load case can be calculated once without input of CTRL PLAB and the
second time with CTRL PLAB 0 and another load case number. The beam internal forces and
moments of both calculations can be represented then with the same scale in a picture.

first during the design of the T-beam. Normal forces are not considered during the calculation
of the FE system. The effective width has to be estimated manually and defined. In reality the
normal forces act from the supports into the plate. For a more precise calculation three pos-
sibilities are described here. For all three variants the effective width is realized automatically
via the normal force calculation and has not to be input:

sary for the system input. This complicates the input. Problems occur also for the design,
because the sum of the internal forces from web+plate including the parts of Steiner are
necessary for a design of the total T-beam. The method is therefore only reasonable for
composite slabs with eccentrically defined steel beams (see ASE example 5.3).

2. The web can be also generated with shell elements. The same problems for the design
result as for the eccentrical beam. In addition it should be noted that the area in the
intersection point plate-web is not defined twice:
Figure2.9: Shellelements
3. The SOFiSTiK offers the eccentrical plate elements as a real alternative. The system
is generated here with different thick plate elements. The plate elements get a larger

beam elements stand only below out. Normal forces which are considered for the design
are produced due to the eccentrical position of the elements. Thereby the usual plate
design is done simultaneously the beam design - a special beam design is therefore
not necessary. The FE analysis uses here automatically the real effective width via the

100% of the force in longitudinal direction in the beam section. In the T-Beam philosophy on

Figure2.12: Internallyusedstiffnesspartsinlongitudinaldirection
The double defined concrete part (beam+quad) is now substracted using a correction beam.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-11ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
This correction beam is created automatically using TBEX and has a negative stiffness to
compensate the double concrete part, also in excentric position. You can say it is an excentric
beamwithnegativeE-modulus. Theforcesofthethreepartsarenowasshowninfigure2.13:

M = -80 kNm
Figure2.13: Forcesofthethreepartse.g. on1000kNmexternalbendingmoment
As the correction beam compensates the stiffness of the quads in longitudinal direction of the
bridge, the real beam gets the full bending moment of the bridge as in a discretisation with
beams only.
The quad elements are excentrically above the center of gravity of the beam and so get a
compression normal force. The correction beam gets the oposite forces due to the negative
stiffness. We see that the sum of forces of all three parts is exactly N=0 and M= 1000 kNm.
All forces are related to the center of the individual part as they also appear in WINGARF and
AQB.
Comment to internal analysis: the real beam also stores the forces of the correction beam.
Setting on a primary load case (CSM construction stages), all parts are taken into account
correctly. Fortemperatureloadingandcreepandshrinkagethisisdoneaswell. Thecorrection

and 2nd order theory. It is numerically integrated with the complete system of 12 differential
equations. Pile elements get a minimal constraint of the rotational spring in order to prevent
instabilities.
Example see single_pile.dat
These equations are integrated numerically with the Runge-Kutta method.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-13ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
With GRP FACB the bedding can be varied, e.g for an analysis with critical values.

InthiswayalsosystemwithpileelementscanbeusedincludingcreepinCSM.Shrinkagewill
never be taken into account for piles, creep acts for the pile and the bedding! If GRP PHIF is
input this value is taken for both the pile and the bedding.
The pile element is not contained in the basic licence of ASE.
2.4.1 Winkler Coefficient
For their definition it is most important to take into account that the Winkler coefficient is not a
simple material property but depends on the system dimensions and the loading. The Winkler
coefficientdefinesthestresscausedbyagivendeformationwhereastheinfluenceofadjacent
points (shear deformations) is not taken into account. The dimension of a bedding is therefore
given as kN/m3. A displacement causes a stress (kN/m2).
However, the pile bedding is defined in kN/m2 since the pile ”width” has to be integrated into
this value. In this case, a displacement causes a load (kN/m). Since the pile width influences
also the Winkler coefficient, the pile dimensions are dropped possibly from the equation and
the pile Winkler coefficient can be estimated also from the elastic modulus of the soil and a
form factor.
ForcircularpilecrosssectionsandaPoisson’sratioof0.4aformfactorof1.12canbederived.
For a Poisson’s ratio of 0.0 the form factor would be 1.57. In EBK 82 of the Road Traffic

2.4.2 Numerical Solution and Accuracy
In general, the set of differential equations can not be solved directly. Therefore, for each pile,
theseequationsareintegratednumericallybytheRunge-Kuttamethod. Thestepwidthiscon-
trolledautomaticallytomaintainarelativeaccuracyof0.01percent. Thesettingofhighererror
limitsresultsinareductionoftheCPUtime. Thesettingofsmallererrorlimitsisreasonableup
to a certain value, which depends on the machine accuracy of the computer used. The reduc-
tion of the error limit below a certain value is not reasonable because the computational error
increases again due to the rounding errors in the high number of the necessary additions.
In the case of an unbedded beam the step width can be set very large. By contrast, for
large Winkler coefficients the numerical calculation becomes more difficult. As a criterion the
characteristic length is used, defined as:
L= (cid:112)4 4·E/K (2.1)
This value is an estimation of the distance between the zero points of the solution function.
For reasons with reference to the numerical integration, the characteristic length should not
become less than 1/5 up to 1/10 of the element length. If this condition is not satisfied, great
accuracyproblemsmayoccurresultingindifferentialforcesinthenodeswhicharepointedout
in an error message.
2-14 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
These problems can be overcome by subdividing a pile into more subelements.
In the case that a pile is subdivided into more elements, the placing of the nodes at points of
changing soil parameters (layers) is to be preferred over an uniform subdivision.
Pile elements get a minimal constraint of the rotational spring in order to prevent instabilities.
If otherwise nothing was specified, a linear analysis is performed. Non-linear effects are:
• Different bedding in various transverse directions (F1 - term of the series sequence)
• Limitation of the maximum bedding stresses
• Second order theory
For these cases an iterative calculation has to be carried out.

2.5 Truss and Cable Elements

An internal cable sag is considered for geometrically non-linear analysis and SYST-PROB-

the sagging f iteratively using common equations for the elastic plane stressed cable. For the

2.6 Spring Elements
Spring elements idealize structural parts by means of a simplified force-displacement relation-
ship. This is usually a linear equation which is based on the spring constant:
P=C· (2.2)
A spring is defined with a direction (dX, dY, dZ) and three spring constants.
Thehereimplementedelementallowsthefollowingnon-lineareffectswhichareofcourseonly
usefully during a non-linear analysis:
• prestress (linear effect)
• failure
• yield
• friction with cohesion (sliding friction and stiction see CTRL SPRI V4)
• slip
• spring nonlinear work laws, please refer to section 3.37
• springs with a reference area AR and a nonlinear material work law
Figure2.18: Springforce-displacementdiagrams
A prestress displaces the corresponding effects and produces always a loading which acts on
thestructure. Aprestressshouldnotbedefinedinthesystemgenerationbecauseitactsinall
loadcases. It is better to use the prestress in ASE...PREX. A prestressed spring gets a relax-
ation in the absence of external loading or constraints. The non-linear effects are considered
both for rotational and displacement springs. Friction can be defined with a lateral spring. The
force component perpendicular to the spring effect direction results from the product of the
displacement component in the lateral direction multiplied by the lateral spring constant. The
2-16 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
maximum value of this force, however, is equal to the force in the primary direction multiplied
by the friction coefficient plus the cohesion. If the primary spring fails, the lateral spring gets
eliminated too.

elements appears directly in the form of support reactions at the corresponding nodes. For
BOUN additional distributed boundary forces are stored for graphical output.
Distributed support reactions are determined for boundary elements with number (compare
program SOFIMSHA/SOFIMSHC). If two boundaries are defined at an edge, the distributed
support reactions are calculated once only and they are output for the boundary with the
smaller boundary number. Single supports can not be considered by boundary elements.

Because the normal element remains plane, the bending and the membrane structural be-

separately for the both components. Additionally the consideration of the components of an

The ASE element is defined as a general quadrilateral. The accuracy of the solution, how-
ever, depends on the geometry of the element, thus not all conceivable element shapes are
permitted.
The optimum element is the square or the equilateral triangle. Rectangles and parallelograms
are the second-best shape and the general quadrilateral the third-best. General quadrilaterals
with re-entrant corners are not allowed in the element formulation.
A rectangle with a large side ratio a/b has difficulties in the representation of the twisting mo-
ments and also for the bending near a corner. A ratio of 1:5 is still tolerated in the program
SOFIMSHA/SOFIMSHC and it should be exceeded only in exceptions. The size ratio of two
adjacent elements should not be smaller than approx. 1:5. However, this value is relatively
uncritical.
The ratio thickness to element dimension is uncritical, because a shear correction factor is
applied. It should be clear to the user, however, that the shear deformations in the case of
thick plates result in deviations from the Kirchhoff’s theory. The ratio of the thicknesses of two
adjacent elements should not be smaller than 1:10 due to its cubic effect.
2.8.1 Plate Structural Behaviour
The ASE element for the plate structural behaviour is based on Mindlin’s plate theory, as de-
scribed in the implementations of Hughes and Tezduyar [6], Tessler and Hughes [7] and Cr-
isfield [8], with an extension of a non-conforming formulation, see Fig. 2.21.
The cross sections remain plane also according to Mindlin’s theory, however, they are not
perpendicularanymoretotheneutralaxis. Thesameshapefunctionsasforthedisplacements
are used for the additional shear rotations. The total rotation is then the sum of the shear
deformation and the bending rotation.

2.8.3 Elastic Foundation
TheQUADelementcanbeexpandedwithstiffnesscomponentsinordertodescribeanelasti-
cally supported area. Only appropriate inputs can activate this foundation component.
The foundation can be defined both perpendicularly and tangentially to the area. The non-
linear effects like failure, yielding and friction may be specified.
Thefoundationcoefficientindicatesthestressresultingatapointwhichissubjectedtoacertain
displacement. It is not a material constant, it is calculated later with a settlement analysis. In
principle,itsvaluealwaysconsistsofanelasticmodulustogetherwithageometricaldimension.
Thedisplacementsofadjacentpointsareindependentofeachother,sincesheardeformations
are not taken into consideration with this method.
A more exact analysis of foundations according to the stiffness modulus method is possible
with the program HASE.
The easiest case is a single compressible layer of uniform thickness h. The calculation of the
Winkler coefficient is achieved by applying a constant stress and by computing the resultant
displacement. In the case of hindered lateral strain the result is
E (1−μ) E
s
C= · = (2.35)
h (1+μ)·(1−2μ) h
In analog mode one can obtain Winkler coefficients for multi-layered systems. These coeffi-
cients are more acceptable as the layer becomes thinner in comparison to its deformation. If,
however, the layer is relatively thick in comparison to the loaded area, or if it is infinitely thick,
theWinklercoefficienthastobeestimatedinasettlementanalysisatthepointofinterest. The
horizontal foundation has usually the same order of magnitude.
Column heads are defined sometimes with elastic foundations, especially in the case of ma-
sonry. By defining the Winkler coefficient one must keep in mind, that a two-dimensional
foundation develops a certain rotational spring effect which is more important to the loading of
a plate than the perpendicular displacement spring.
A column of the height h which is supported articulated at its foot has a rotational stiffness
equal to
3·E
C ϕ = (2.36)
h
This stiffness should correspond to a rotational spring foundation with
C ϕ =C· (2.37)
SOFiSTiK2023 2-23ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
From that follows
3·E
C= (2.38)
h
The corresponding value for a column fixed at its foot is 4·E/h.
Therefore it is correct to define a foundation three till four times higher, instead of the Winkler
coefficient E/h, in order to describe the rotational foundation properly. If, however, the plate is
supported articulated on the column, this type of foundation should not be used in any case
because of its clamping effect against rotation. In this case it is recommended to use a single
pointsupportofanodeanddistributetheloadbymeansofrigidorelasticelements(kinematic
constraints).
Support reactions which result from a QUAD foundation are printed and stored as nodal sup-
port reactions. Thus a graphical check of the support reactions is facilitated.
2.8.4 Rotations around the Shell Normal
The rotational degree of freedom around the shell normal is not contained in both load bear-
ing behaviours. In order to prevent numerical difficulties for three-dimensional structures, the
Inplane-rotationofthenodesiscoupledviaaweaktorsionalspringatthedisplacementsofthe
corner nodes in an intern way.
2.8.5 Twisted Shell Elements
If not all four nodes of an element lie in a plane (e.g. in the case of a hypershell), then the
program defines an eccentric kinematic constraint of the corner nodes at a plane element in a
median plane in an intern way. Three-dimensional curved structures may be analysed in this
way with sufficient accuracy.
In the case of twisted shell elements as well as geometrically non-linear analyses (twisted
elements are generated automatically with the latter), internal springs are used now instead
of the rotational stiffnesses mentioned in the previous paragraph. These springs convert the
moment loading of a node around the shell normal to axial forces in the shell. The shear
stiffness of the elements is modified slightly with this method, however, this is the only way to
achieve moment equilibrium at the nodes of three-dimensional curved structures.
2.8.6 Eccentrically Connected Shell Elements
InthecaseofT-beams,itisanadvantagetolayallnodesintheplaneofthetopsurfaceofthe
plate and to connect the elements with different thicknesses eccentrically to this plane. Then
the T-beam effect is realized correctly.
The position of the elements is input in the program SOFIMSHA/SOFIMSHC (e.g. QUAD ...
POSI=BELO).
Example see csm32_slab_design.dat

2.8.8 Non-conforming Formulation
The 4-node element with QTYP-0 is characterised through only bilinear accretion of the dis-
placements and rotations. This accretion describes a uniform variation of the shear force and
of the bending moment via a transformation. This element is called conforming, because the
displacements and the rotations between elements do not have any jumps. The results at the
gravity centre of the element represent the actual internal force variation fairly well, whilst the
results at the corners are relatively useless, especially the ones at the edges or at the corners
of a region.
TaylorandWilsoncameupwiththeideatodescribemorestressstatesthroughadditionalfunc-
tionsthatvalueiszeroatallnodes. Asarule,thesefunctionsleadtoasubstantialimprovement
of the results, however, they violate the continuity of displacements between elements. Thus
they are called non-conforming elements.
On the example of a membrane action the effect or the nonconforming shape functions can
be clarified best. In fig. 2.21 on top we see an element with QTYP 0 forced with a constand
inplane bending disc moment, applied with two pairs of membrane forces. The linear shape
functions only allow the plotted displacement. The high shear deformations attract a lot of
energy and so the element is much to stiff for this action.
Onthebottomanelementwithnonconformingquadraticinternshapefunctionsisshown. This
element can represent this action exactly without shear deformations and delivers a correct
stiffness.

In ASE the more powerful QTYP 1 element is the default. With CTRL option QTYP the simple
element can be selected for special test cases.
QTYP 0 regularconformingelementaccordingtoHughesandTezduyar[6]orZienkiewicz
QTYP 1 non-conforming element with six functions based on Hughes and Tezduyar [6] or
Wilson (default value)
Elements of type 0 can describe only uniform moments and membrane forces inside them.
Elements of type 1 can describe a linear moment variation, if they are rectangular, whereas
a general quadrilateral element can only do that approximately. Membrane forces can vary
linearly.
More explanations of the element properties can also be found in the manual of the program
TALPA.
2.9 Volume Elements
The volume element (BRIC) represents an elastic body and it is defined by means of 8 nodes.
Even uniform bending states of a structure can be realized exactly via non-conforming accre-
tions using hexaeders.
For tetraeder, quadratic shape functions are added at the edges internally - see CTRL BRIC
4. Without these modes, tetraeder should not be used, as linear shape functions can not
represent a uniform bending states!
The intern used p-version shape functions can also have higher polynomial degree, see Fig.
2.22 and 2.23 but working with PLC primary loadcases only the quadratic edge modes are
used. For higher modes we do not have storage space in the database up to now. We also
found that the higher modes do not produce much more accuracy. So also for stress output it
is better to refine the mesh instead of using higher modes.

statical systems can be selected through the assignment of the elements in groups.
ASE has, however, also a very efficient possibility to use stresses and deformations of a pri-
maryloadcasewhichallowthecompleteconsiderationofeffectsfromcreeporsystemchange.
See also module CSM Construction stage manager.
Duringapplicationtheusermustkeepinmindthateachstressstateinasingleelementcorre-
sponds to an external loading of the element and is in equilibrium with that loading.
ASE calculates now equivalent forces from the internal forces or stresses of the elements and
canapplythemasloading(GRP...FACL).Theseforcescreateadeformationstatewhichcoun-
teracts the internal forces and makes them to zero when the statical system is not changed. If
a system change has taken place in the meanwhile or if these loads have been applied with
different factors, corresponding inherent stress states result.
Following principal cases have to be distinguished:
1. IftheoldloadingisactivatedtogetherwiththeprimarystatewithafactorGRP...FACL=1.0,
new loads do not result. The stresses remain the same, the deformations are zero. Ac-
cordingtoSYST...PLCthetotaldeformationsoratSYST...PLC=0onlytheadditiondefor-
mations are output.
2. If only the primary state is applied as loading with a factor GRP ... FACL=0, the resultant
loading is the primary load case with inverted sign. This gives rise to unloading defor-
mationsthatgenerateastressstatewhichbecomeszerotogetherwiththeprimarystress
stateinthecaseoffreedeformability. ThisFACL=0methodshouldonlybeusedinspecial
cases. FACL=1 is the usual default.
A graphical explanation to this can also be found in figure 2.30 :taking over the primary load

2.11 Non-linear Analyses
Non-linear effects can be analysed only with iterations. This is done in ASE usually with a
modified Newton method with constant stiffness matrix. The advantages of the method are
2-28 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
thatthestiffnessmatrixdoesnotneedtobedecomposedmorethanonceandthatthesystem
matrix remains always positive definite. The speed of the method is increased through an
accelerating algorithm written by Crisfield. This method notices the residual forces developing
during the iterations and calculates the coefficients e and f for the displacement increments of
the current and the previous step. A damping of the method can be specified in the case of
critical systems (SYST...FMAX<1.0).
For a geometric nonlinear analsis a Line Search technique with an update of stiffness is used
- see CTRL ITER.
Examples see -> Summary of example overviews
Following non-linear effects are implemented currently: please also refer to NSTR in section
3.37:
• Spring elements (failure, yield, slip, friction, work laws)
• QUAD foundation elements (failure, yield, slip, friction)
• Cable elements ( compression failure, material work laws)
• Truss elements (tension failure, material work laws)
• Nonlinear bedding for PILE elements
• Nonlinear beam elements
• Non-linear material laws for QUAD and BRIC elements
• Geometrically non-linear analyses for all elements, cable sag, membranes
Tendons defined in the QUAD elements with the program TENDON can be used only in geo-
metrically linear analysis.
For TRUS, SPRI, CABL, BEAM, QUAD and BRIC in a geometrically non-linear analysis the
initial stress matrix is added to the stresses of the primary stress state (for TRUS, SPRI and
CABLwithoutreferencetoaprimarystressstate,theprestressfromtheprogramSOFIMSHA/-
SOFIMSHC is used for this purpose - see CTRL CABL). Thereby the iterations are markedly
morestablewhenreferringtoaprimaryloadcaseandtheultimateloadcanbecalculatedmore
precisely. Astabilityfailureisrecognizedalsointhisway,eveninthecaseswithoutunplanned
initial deformation (an unstable system is reported, if the stresses of the primary state exceed
the buckling load, i.e. the total stiffness matrix is negative). Since it is reported here, that the
PLC was actually unstable, this feature is only meaningful in the case of small load steps.
A module for the ultimate load calculation ULTI increases or decreases the load step-by-step
until it reaches a still sustained loading.
Initial deformations of the structure can be read as results of already analysed load cases
withtherecordSYST...PLC...FACV.WithGRP...FACL=0theinitialdeformationisappliedwith-
out stresses. This can also be done more clearly with OBLI (the OBLI oblique position or
predeformation can also be mixed with a primary stress state SYST PLC). In the stored re-
sults, the initial deformation is added to the incremental displacements of the actual loadcase.
With CTRL DIFF the increment can be stored separately. Deformations from a modal analy-
sis (bucling eigenvalue) can be used as initial deformation via scaling with FACV or OBLI see

The relaxation in individual layers, due to former plastification, is considered by consistently
saving the results in all the layers of the elements (hysteresis effect for the bending of plates).
This could create residual stresses over the cross-sectional height, even after total relaxation.

sition could be created due to stiffer layers on one side of the element, e.g. sandwich-element
with different top-layer thicknesses. The eccentricity is established automatically and is con-
sidered for simple plate bending, it also leads the correct length deformation of the elements.
This effect also becomes apparent for an eccentric connection with a homogeneous element.
Theinputoforthotropicmaterialsisnotallowed,duetotheoccurrenceofvariouseccentricities
in various directions. This is blocked by the program and leads to an error message.
Linearnormal-stressesinthelayersaregeneratedbythestrainsinthelayers. Theyarecalcu-
lated as usual by the stress-strain matrix D of the material in a layer:
δσ =D ·δϵ  (2.39)
where the matrix D can also be orthotropic.
The linear total stress is made up of all the stress components including the allowed factors
out of the ASE-GRP input:
σ =FACL·FCREEP2·σ +
 ,PLC
+FACS·FCREEP1·D ·(δϵ +ϵ ,LOAD)+σ  (2.40)
with:
SOFiSTiK2023 2-35ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples

FACL Factor of the primary stress record ASE-GRP
FACS Factor of the stiffness record ASE-GRP

FCREEP2 Reduction of the primary stress through creep and shrinkage, by taking
over the primary load case with ro and dphi from record GRP
FCREEP2 = 1 - dphi/(1 + ro·dphi))
(dphi = creep increment of a creep step component)
ε ,LOAD Load expansion (temperature or expansion load)
σ  Pre-stress (record GRP-PREX)
The GRP factor FACL is generally multiplied to the primary load-case as a value of 1.0. It
generates the expansion loads from the primary stresses σ ,PLC. If the stresses of the PLC
together with the loads of the PLC are multiplied with the factors FACL=1.0, then the system
will remain in equilibrium and no additional expansions or displacements are created. The
FACL expansion loads are then in equilibrium with the external loads:
Figure2.30: Loadequilibriumwhentakingovertheprimaryloadcasewithoutanynewloads
The nodal load resulting from FACL and the element stress is generated because the element
wants expand due to the primary compressive stress.
The internal forces and moments are calculated by integrating the stresses in the layers, over
the element thickness of each layer.
Shear
Initially the shear stiffnesses of the individual layers are summed up for the stiffness determi-
nation.
2-36 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
The following equation is used to calculate the shear stress from the shear force q.
q·S

τ  = (2.41)
·b
For homogenous material definitions, in the linear domain, this would result in a parable-
shaped shear stress distribution over the height of the element, with the maximum value of
τ m = 1.5·q/h. For sandwich elements, with thick (strong) top-layers, it would mean that a
nearly constant shear stress is present in the middle of the element; given by τ m =1.0·q/h
(h=element thickness).
2.12.4 Steel plates
Example see ase12_buckling_slab.dat
For a non-linear analysis, the calculation of the new linear stresses is initially made by assum-
ing a linear material behaviour for every layer xi. The following applies when proceeding with
the primary load case:
σ  =σ ,PLC+D ·dϵ  (2.42)
and
τ  =τ ,PLF+dτ  (2.43)
(simplified)
The total stress σ  is therefore not just put together by the total strain multiplied with the
stiffness,insteaditmightbethatthenon-lineareigen-stressesoftheindividuallayersofσ
,PLC
have to be considered. For the consistent treatment of the problem, including the correct
generation of the loading- and unloading curves of the layer model, it is of importance that not
onlytheinternalforcesandmomentsarestoredinthedatabase,butalsoallthestressinallthe
layers and all the Gauss-points. This information is needed for the next load case as σ ,PLC.
From these initial linear stresses a new linear comparison stress is calculated:
For QUAD elements the following applies:
(cid:114)
σ  = σ 2+σ y2−σ ·σ y+3τ 2 y+3τ 2+3τ y2 (2.44)
where τ y = disc shear and τ , τ y = plate shear perpendicular to the plate.
If the so calculated linear comparison stress σ , is above the allowed stress (by considering
the hardening, which is calculated by summing up the plastic strains, by entering a trilinear
stress-strain curve); then first of all the linear component is established (Break-through point
through the plastic area). Then the remaining strain increment δdε  with the elastoplastic
materialmatrixD-Pisappliedincrementally,withtheconsiderationofpossiblehardening. The
non-linear relaxation lies on the surface of the plastic area. The number of plastic increments
of the strain increment can be changed in the input CTRL MSTE. The non-linear material
behaviourisaccordingtotheelasto-plasticplastic-law,describedinTALPA,whichisaccording
to van MISE and includes hardening. For more information on this topic you are referred to
Zienkiewicz [10].
The following diagram results from uniaxial stress:

Plastification number:
In WINGRAF you can plot a plastification number f. This is similar to the f-value for soil me-
chanical yielding (AQUA-VMIS) and indicates a reference to the yielding limit fy:
ƒ =(σ ner−ƒy)/ƒy (2.45)
where σ linear is calcualted from the strain using a linear E modulus (E*ε).
Example steel with fy=500 N/mm2 E=200000 N/mm2 :
ε-x = 1.25 o/oo -> σ linear = 250 N/mm2 -> f= = negative = still in the linear region

ε-x = 2.50 o/oo -> σ linear = 500 N/mm2 -> f=. = just at the yielding limit

ε-x = 3.75 o/oo -> σ linear = 750 N/mm2 -> f= = positive = in the nonlinear region

shear force) remains constant and can not be increased any further through hardening. The
thus established shear force stress is then basically substituted as a constant component into
the calculation of the comparison stress. It has started to plasticising. This would then lead
to the following: e.g. in plate bending; the shear stresses in the plastified plate edge would
not increase anymore, however in the middle of the plate they would still get bigger, this in
turn would cause a deviation from the parable-shaped shear stress distribution over the plate
thickness,whichwouldinturncauseaconcentrationoftheshearstressesinthemiddleofthe

2.12.5 Concrete
Examples see ase.dat\...\nonlinear_quad\ a1_introduction_example.dat The following litera-
ture was consulted on the concrete material law: Stempniewski and Eibl [11], Feenstra and
De Borst [12], and Schiessel [13]
Following current assessments and explanations are mentioned here additionally: xx [14],
2-38 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
Zilch and Rogge [15], Bellmann and Rötzer [16], xx [17], and Schneider [18]
The material behaviour of reinforced concrete can be described by the following properties:
• Non-linear stress-strain curve in tension and compressive zone
• Contribution of the concrete between cracks (tension stiffening)
• Non-linear material behaviour of the steel inserts
• Simplified check of the plate’s shear stress
• ASE performs a nonlinear analysis with a given reinforcement. An increase of reinforce-
ment can be controlled via REIQ-CHKR.
Usual procedure:
The element is subdivided into NLAY layers. The stresses sigma-x, sigma-y and tau-xy and
the principal stresses sigma-I and sigma-II are calculated for every layer’s boundary. For each
principal stress direction a stress-strain curve is generated, which results from the principal
stress relation in the respective direction. The thus established non-linear stresses are then
integrated over all the layers to find the internal forces. After this all the forces of the reinforce-
ment including the tension-stiffening-effect are added. Finally an independent check is made
for the plate’s shear stresses.
The following is a list of the concrete parameters taken from record CONC:
CONC-FC = calculation value of the concrete stiffness
CONC-FCT = average tension stiffness for tension stiffening
CONC-FCTK = lower fractile of the tension stiffness for bare concrete
CONC-GC = GC compression fracture energy
CONC-GF = GF tension fracture energy
CONC-MUEC = friction value in the crack splice
Further inputs in ASE:
LC - BET2 = load duration coefficient (beta2)
CTRL - NLAY = number of layers to be calculated >=6,
default = 10
Analysis on Serviceability Stress Level
Usingthe1.0-timesserviceabilityloadsthemaximumdesiredstressisinputforthisserviceabil-
ity state at the material. The deformation and crack width to be expected is in this case mostly
interesting. Theinputoftheconcretetensilestrengthofthe(pure)concretelayerisparticularly
important. This value is input in AQUA in CONC...FCTK and it can be modified subsequently
temporarily in ASE with CTRL CONC V3+V4. The serviceability stress-strain curve without
any additional material safeties is requested then in ASE (NSTR KSV SL = default).
The selection of a realistic concrete tensile strength fctk (pure strength without reinforcement)
is here very important. If fctk or CTRL CONC V4 is not input, the plate remains in uncracked
state I. It can be therefore reasonable to decrease the value e.g. onto 60 % in order to con-
SOFiSTiK2023 2-39ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
sider a crack predamage from construction stage (hydration heat). On the other hand realistic
deflections are resulted often only with a high initial value for fctk.
Analysis with gamma-times Loads
If using gamma-times loads the corresponding material stress-strain curve has to be selected
in record NSTR in ASE. There are two possibilities that are also well shown in the beam
example aseaqb_1_column_cracked.dat :
• Analysisaccordingto"non-linearmethod": Hereanaveragedmaterialsafetyof1.3isused.
The material strengths are modified for this purpose. They are available AQUA and can be
requested in ASE with NSTR KSV CALD.
• Analysis in ultimate limit state NSTR KSV ULD

or 0.01 must be input!
Theincreaseofthesteelstressduetotheconcreteactionbetweenthecracksmaybebrought
into approach (default for fct or CTRL CONC V3).
A non-linear analysis for the ultimate limit state is particularly necessary for additional effects
from second-order theory. Such an analysis with temporarily switched-off tensile strength of
the pure concrete causes however often big deformations and bad convergences.
A reasonable procedure is therefore often also a determination of the internal forces and mo-
mentswithaveragevaluesofthematerialstrengths(analysisinserviceabilitylimitstate)anda
definitive design of the redistributed internal forces and moments with an average load safety
coefficient (e.g. 1.45)
Futher explanations see example a2_nonlinear_slab.dat
Non-linear Stress-Strain Curve in the Compressive Zone
The maximum concrete compression strength beta-ic, found in the compressive zone, is re-
duced from the principal stress relation. Beta-ic can either be read from the Kupfer curve, or it
can be calculated by the respective equations [ 1] , pg. 260.
2-40 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
Figure2.32: BiaxialfailurecurveaccordingtoKupfer-Hilsdorf-Ruesch
With this maximum value beta-ic an uniaxial stress-strain line can be generated according to
the concrete stress-strain curve for every of both principal stress directions.
An increase value higher than 1.0 is only allowed for calculations in serviceability limit state.
For calculations with gamma-times loads (ultimate limit state) this increase is deactivated in
the default, because it is mostly desired that the maximum stress increases about the basic
value of the concrete compressive strength beta-ic - see CTRL CONC V2.
A reduction of the permissible compressive stresses due to lateral tension (and lateral cracks)
is taken into account and can be adapted with CTRL CONC V6. The maximum reduction is
reachedwithatransversetensionstressoffctk(oratleast-0.05*fcm)andremainsonthislevel
also on higher tensile strains.
In case the maximum concrete compression strength is modified, the work law must be
adapted. To keep the start E modulus as well as the strain for max. strength, the worklay
is compressed from 0.0-1.0 permille strain and lengthened in 1.5-2.5 permille.
Tensile zone

energy GF of the processing zone. Typical values lie between 0.10 and 0.25 Nmm/mm2. The
program restricts the length of the descending curve to 5·epslin - see CTRL CONC VAL.
Ifastress-straincurveforconcreteisalreadydefinedinthetensilezoneinAQUA,thenthisone
is used instead of the here described program-internal curve! Thus it is possible to calculated
steel fibre concrete -> steel_fibre_concrete.dat
SOFiSTiK2023 2-41ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
Figure2.33: Uniaxialstress-straincurveforthetensilezone
The element is seen as cracked as soon as the tensile-strain crosses the linear limit value
of epslin. Any further strain is stored as plastic tensile-strain and is taken into account for
reloading after an element has been unloaded (hysteresis). Due to the possibility of excessive
tensile stiffness perpendicular to the first crack, the program has to store two plastic tensile-
strains at each point (first crack and second crack).
It could be that a crack has already emerged when a primary load case is taken over. In
this case the fixed crack direction of the primary load case is used for the calculation of the
stresses. Forthiscalculationthestrainsinthedirectionofthecrackandperpendiculartoitare
used. When a possible shear stress is present at the crack it is lowered by a simple friction
consideration (Crack-toothing input with AQUA-CONC-MUEC).
In case the primary load case was cracked and the tensile strain goes back to 0 again, ASE
does not only goes back to the (0,0) stress point but takes into account a remaining strain of
the crack zone. So a cracked girder remains a little bit curved after unloading.
This is done by going back not to (0,0) but to a so called compression zero point. In ASE this
point lies at 80% of eps-z (eps-z = strain reaching tensile strength). From there (0.8*eps-z,0)
again compression can develop.
Reinforcement
The program takes the defined reinforcement as the default reinforcement. The non-linear
analysis is then performed for the default reinforcement. An automatic increase in lacking
structural safety does not take place! It is therefore the users responsibility to check the cer-
tainty of the convergence of the analysis! Possible residual forces of the non-linear iteration
have to be checked. Since these residual forces are stored as support forces they can be
checked with the program WinGRAF, this is done by generating a plot of the support forces.
During a plate analysis residual forces are also generated in the plate’s plane (normal forces),
this is because the program needs to find equilibrium of the normal stresses.
The reinforcement parameters and a given minimum reinforcement is taken from BEMESS-
PARA or from the corresponding SSD design parameter dialog. REIQ is used to import a
reinforcement from a previously generated BEMESS-analysis. The recommended method is
usedintheexample a2_nonlinear_slab.dat. Ananalysiscanalsobemadewithnon-reinforced
concrete, when no reinforcement is defined. Further information on the program ASE can be
found in the chapter ’Definition of Reinforcement’ as well as the latest TEDDY-Help .
The consideration of the tension stiffening is done generally with a modification of the steel
2-42 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
stress-strain curve described in [ 2] page 269. Since ASE 11.76-21 the consideration in ser-
viceability limit state (NSTR SL/SLD) occurs according to the method of Schießl (DAfStB Heft
400)orEC2,becausemorerealisticdeformationvaluesresulthere. Fortheultimatelimitstate
and the non-linear determination of the internal forces and moments (NSTR UL/ULD or CAL/-
CALD) the consideration of the tension stiffening is done according to the simplified method
of the modified steel strains according to DAfStB Heft 525 / Heft 600. For a better clarity the
in each case used method in ASE is output again at the non-linear properties of the plane
elements.

Figure2.34: Tensilestiffeningacc. toHeft525pictureH8-4andHeft600pictureH5-11
As the pure concrete layers also work in tension, the following working method is used:
• Inafirststepthestrainsinthesteellayersinreinforcementdirectionaredetermined. These
strains are equal to the mean steel strains ε sm according to Schiessel:1994.1.
• UsingthetensileworkinglawthetwomajoringstrainsIandIIaredeterminedbasedonthe
actual tensile strength amd the process zone length LZ (see below):
I: average strain when cracking starts
II: averagestrainforfinishedcrackdevelopment=attheendofthedecreasingpartofthe
tensile work law
• The streel stress is now calculated as follows:
– In interval 0-I the steel stress is linear, concrete works linear.
– In interval I-II the additional strain due to tension stiffening is interpolated linear. Con-
crete descends linear.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-43ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
– After II the full effect of tension stiffening is applied, concrete stress is 0. Reaching the
steel yielding point a trilinear part follows,e.g. the steel working law is used.
• The process zone length LZ is calculated as follows:
example EC=27700 GF_ASE=0.3 fctk=3.71: (EC=tangent at start of stress-strain curve)
Process zone length LZ = GF_ASE*EC/FCTK/FCTK = 0.3*27.7/3.71/3.71 = 0.605 m
In case you use GF in AQUA please notice that ASE internally uses a GF_ASE =
0.35*GF_AQUA. This correction is done to get better results compared to in situ defor-
mations. In reality cracks that occur at the surface quicker develop to the inside of a slab
due to stress range effects.
In SOFiSTiK this length is limited to 0.400 m, because otherwise an FCTK of e.g. 0.5
N/mm2wouldresultinaverylongandunrealisticlength. In”FiniteElementeimStahlbeton
- Betonkalender 1993/I Stempniewski” a value between 200-600 mm is recommended.
• WiththisprocesszonelengthLZandGF_ASEacrackopeningdelta=2*GF_ASE/FCTK
can be calculated. With eps=delta/LZ the length of the descending part will be DEPSX=
0.404promille(relativetoLZ).Thisvalueisthenlimitedto5*lengthoftheincreasingpart=
5*0.134 - not controlling here. This strain DEPSX is used in ASE for the plot of the stress
strain curve – that means for an element with the element gauss point size LZ.
• In the real analysis now this strain DEPSX= 0.404 promille is scaled to the actual element
gauss point size.
e.g. element area = 0.05m*0.05m = 0.0025m2 = per gauss point 0.000625m2 -> element
gauss point size L_Gauss = squareroot(0.000625m2) = 0.025m.
– For an actual element with L_Gauss > LZ, DEPSX_GAUSS is calculated to
DEPSX_GAUSS = DEPSX*LZ/L_Gauss (descending part is shortened).
– ForanactualelementwithL_Gauss<LZ,DEPSX_GAUSS=DEPSX.Thatmeansthat
the descending part will not be elongated!
So for an element size of 0.05m*0.05m a descending part of DEPSX_GAUSS = DEPSX =
0.404 promille is taken into account.
• For the new design codes (and without the input of CTRL CONC V5 400) the crack width
is then calculated according to DIN 1045.1 11.2.4 or according to the Eurocode equation.
The average force of the steel insert is calculated by multiplying the steel stress for the
crack cross section in the cracked condition (state II) σ s with the reinforced concrete area.
This value is added to the concrete’s internal forces and moments.
The crack widths are first calculated in the direction of the reinforcements using the eu-
ropean coefficients according EN 1992-1-1 7.3.4(1) inclusive equation 7.14. If the crack
direction is not perpendicular to the reinforcement, the crack distance and the crack width
are modified according to EN 1992-I-I 7.3.4(4).
Fornon-reinforcedelementsitisonlypossibletocalculatethecrackdirection,butthecrack
widthcannotbeestablished. TogetanacceptableplotinWINGRAF,afiktivereinforcement
is assumed and with this a crack width is calculated. But this crack width is only qualitativ,
not qantitative.
For steel fibre concrete without additional reinforcement the crack distance es fixed to 140
mm. For steel fibre concrete with real reinforcement a correction factor 1-alfaf is taken into
account (DAfStb-Richtlinie for steel fibre concrete, DIN EN 1992-1-1, new text (R.6)P and
2-44 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
(R.7)P).
ThecoefficientdescribingtheconnectionpropertiesistobedefinedinAQUA-STEE.Thefactor
for the influence of the load period is input in ASE-LC.
For ultimate limit state the calculation is done according to Heft 525 / Heft 600, if DIN 1045-1,
DIN FB 102 or EN 1992-1-1 is set.
Shear force
Theshearstressesfortheconcretelawarenotcalculatedforeachlayer,asisthecaseforthe
plastic yield criteria of STEEL, instead a simple shear limitation of the shear force is set with
an assumed shear stress in the cracked condition (state II) of
τ=q/z=q/(0.8·h) (2.46)
where h represents average of all the reinforcement layers.
Ifthelinearcalculatedshearstressτrisesovertheshearresistance,theshearforceisreduced
accordingly and the element gets plastic shear deformations. By default the shear resistance
is the bond stress FBD from AQUA. It can be changed with ASE-CTRL FRIC in N/mm2. Then
with TAU2...V2 a descending part with a final strength can be defined.
Theshearlimitationisonlycalculatedforthecentreofgravity. Thenitisproportionallyassigned
to all the Gauss points.
If a BEMESS calculation with punching occurs before the non-linear ASE calculation, then a
check of the shear stresses in ASE is not done in the areas of the punching point. In fine
meshes around a punching node also the support force is distributed to round up the bending
(peak smoothing see following chapter and CTRL BETO V7).
If this is not the case or if the permissible shear stress is exceeded at other singular points, an
undesirable shear plasticity can be switched off with an increase of CTRL TAU2 onto e.g. 9.9
N/mm2 if required. Then a shear or punching check has to be done however separately.
Procedure of a Reinforced Concrete Plate Analysis
Usually the system is to be defined as a three-dimensional system, this is because the crack
opening will cause horizontal node displacements, even in the plate analysis. For the special
case of a reinforced-concrete plate analysis the system can also be entered as a girder grid
SYSTROST- theprogramwillthenautomaticallyintroducea horizontalstaticallydeterminate
support.
The first step would involve a linear analysis of the individual load cases, a superposition of
the load cases and a reinforced concrete design calculation of the linear internal forces and
moments. BEMESS will store the required reinforcement dimensions under the design case
number 1 (see BEMESS-CTRL-LCR).
Subsequently a state load case has to be put together for the non-linear analysis. For the
calculation of long-term deformations the load case components consist of self weight and a
portion of the imposed load. A linear analysis of this load case is made, which is needed as a
comparativereferencelateron. Nowthenon-linearanalysisofthisloadcase,underadifferent
load case number and with a predefined reinforcement, is calculated (design parameter from
SOFiSTiK2023 2-45ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
BEMESS-PARA and input for ASE-REIQ).
The convergence of this non-linear analysis needs to be checked. The program finds a stable
solution for the case where the energy remains the same (Energy convergence). Varying
residual forces might occur due to inadequate convergence in the normal force directions.
Thesearegenerallynotofimportance,butshouldbecheckedwithWinGRAF...nodes...residual
forces.
The first load case of the non-linear analysis is usually calculated by excluding creep and
shrinkage. Subsequently another non-linear calculation is made, including creep and shrink-
age, under a different load case number. This is done so that the different effects can be
compared and evaluated. It is also advisable to generate several calculations where the con-
crete stiffness FCTK is altered, due to the fact that this parameter has a significant impact on
the entire analysis.
The entire analysis should then be verified with the following load case results:
• linear analysis of the state load case
• non-linear analysis without creep and shrinkage
• non-linear analysis with creep and shrinkage

2.12.6 Rounding off over Punching Points
Enhanced computation on singular support points in the material non-linear concrete analysis
(SYST NMAT YES):
Followingproblemexists: Suchsingularsupportscausedsingularforcesthatcouldnotbecar-
riedintheconcretenon-linearmaterialmodel,especiallyincombinationwithsingularrotational
constraints.
AtpunchingnodesfromBEMESSnowafirstsingularsupportorconnectionforce(andbending
moment) will be distributed on neighbouring nodes inside the column perimeter to simulate a
constant distributed support pressure. Thus the feature only works after a BEMESS ultimate
design with PUNC YES or PUNC CHEK! The support force of the centre is distributed via an
internal coupling ring around the centre node and elastic springs to further nodes inside the
column area.
The processing is documented in the statistic print out "rounding singular punching nodes". It
can be switched off with CTRL CONC V7 0. It only works on BEMESS punching nodes but
also if they come from beam connections in a 3D analysis. It also converts singular connec-
tion bending moments in a triangular connection pressure. The effect can be studied well by
2-46 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
comparing a run with CTRL CONC V7 0 and a run with CTRL CONC V7 1.
Especially at fine discretized punching points a rotational constraints will be analyzed more
realistic (stronger). On such points the singular support moment caused a strong singular
curvature in the fine mesh and thus a lower constraint.
In a material linear analysis this feature is switched off by default, but can be enforced with
CTRL CONC V7 1.
2.12.7 Output of the Results
Graphical Representation
The graphical output of the results over the thickness of the QUAD elements is another side
effect of the consistent saving of the results in all the layers. The ANIMATOR can be used for
thevisualizationoftheresults(choosealoadcaseanddoubleklickanelement). Thefollowing
picture shows the stresses in a single QUAD element. The element is a sandwich element,
where the soft inner layer is covered by two harder top-layers.
Figure2.35: Elementinfo
The next picture shows the non-linear stresses in a concrete arched shell. Here the cracks
can be seen in the tensile zone. The thin lines are the stresses in the reinforcement layers.
The significant numerical values, e.g. the maximum steel stress, are output in addition in the
SOFiSTiK2023 2-47ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
dialogue box.

Figure2.36: Visualizationofthenon-linearresults
The visualization of the non-linear results from the steel and concrete law is still possible with
WinGRAF, e.g. the visualization of the crack distribution at the underside of a plate, like in
example of the reinforced concrete slab in cracked condition.
Numerical output of the Results
The entire non-linear results, like the crack widths or stresses in the cracked condition (state
II), can only be released numerically in the ASE calculation. For this the ECHO FORC record
is used. For plastification number: see equation 2.45
Statistics of Non-linear Effects
The available non-linear effects are logged at the end of a non-linear calculation in ASE in
’STATISTIC NONLINEAR EFFEKTS’ For plastification number: see equation 2.45
2.12.8 Miscellaneous Information
Iteration Control - Improvement of the Convergence
Concrete Law
Usually a tolerance of 0.002 is sufficient for the concrete law (record SYST ...TOL). This tol-
erance is also needed for the energy convergence. With negative TOL -1.50 a fixed absolute
tolerance of 1.5 kN can be defined, if necessary not before 40% of the iterations: TOL4 -1.50
The convergence problems in non-linear calculations, which consider the concrete law, could
initially be solved by increasing the number of iterations (SYST...ITER). If after, for example,
50 iteration the energy still increases, the load can not be taken up anymore, this is because:
– a lack of reinforcement (tensile forces can not be compensated anymore)
– the plate is to thin (compression failure)
– the elements next to the singularity are to small (shear problem)
Allthesethreeproblemsleadtoapointwheretheloadcannotbecompensatedanymore,due
2-48 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
to an increase in strain. So the product of load·strain = energy will increase constantly.
This can only be resolved by altering the system:
– increase reinforcement
– adjust the dimensions
– decrease the load (try a lower load step)
If the program does not reach a residual force equilibrium, even if the energy converges (the
energy seems to remain close to the limiting value), then generally it could be attributed
to the following reason: The program does not reach equilibrium in the normal direction
of the plate - small changes in the strain plane generate large normal forces. Although
this phenomena is usually insignificant for plate calculations and only has a local influence
on the result. This becomes apparent when a check is performed on the residual forces
(WinGRAF...nodes...residual forces).
Often a damping of the iteration is successful with SYST...FMAX 0.90 (FMAX smaller than 1.0
or FMAX 1.10).
If no convergence is found, the intermediate results of the iterations are saved with the load
casenumbersfrom90001. TheycanbecheckedintheANIMATORwithdisplacementsandin
WinGRAF with residual forces in order to find out the cause of the lacked convergence. With
ECHO RESI 7 this can be enforced also for a convergent run.
Often the convergence can be improved by the lowering of the concrete tension stiffness e.g.
to 0.5 N/mm2. This is because the negative stiffness, on the decreasing curve of the concrete
stress-strain curve, is not that big and it can be equilibrated by the positive stiffness of the
reinforcement including the tension stiffening. On the other hand it is possible that a bigger
concretetensionstiffnesscouldinstantaneouslyreleasealargeamountofconcretefailureen-
ergy. Thisenergywouldthenspreadlikeachainreactionthroughthesystemandconvergence
would be prevented. An increase in the minimum reinforcement would also improve the con-
vergence,becausethereinforcementwouldcounteractthenegativestiffnessofthedecreasing
stress-strain curve.
Steel Law
Steel plates or shells do not encounter instantaneous tension failure, as is the case for the
concretelaw. Besidesbeingabletoincreasethenumberofiterations(SYST...ITER),onealso
has the possibility to generate a trilinear instead of a bilinear stress-strain curve, which has its
advantages. The tangential stiffness in a bilinear curve is equal to zero, i.e. a strain correction
of the program would not alter the stress. Another advantage is the slowly increasing curve,
which is favourable for the Newton-Raphson-method.
Inadditionthesteellawallowsastep-wiseincreaseoftheload,asdescribedinchapter"bear-
ing load iteration".
Tangential Stiffness
For non-linear material calculations one always works with linear initial stiffness and compen-
sation of the unabsorbed residual forces. An experimental material stiffness was implemented
for improving the convergence of the iterations, but it did not achieve the desired effect and
SOFiSTiK2023 2-49ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
was thus deactivated.
Non-linearmaterialcalculations,accordingtothefirst-ordertheory,utilizetheCrisfieldstandard
(CTRL ITER 0) in the iteration control. The line-search with the geometric-tangential stiffness
matrix is only utilized in case of second-order theory are crack springs (CTRL ITER 3). The
material matrix is always substituted with the linear initial stiffness and is not tangentially up-
dated.
YoucanalwaystrybothvariantsCTRLITER0orCTRLITER3butpleasestartwiththedefault
(no input to CTRL ITER).
Bearing Load Iteration
In a lot of cases it is of interest to establish the maximum bearing load of a given system.
To do this the bearing load iteration is applied. Here the load is increased step-wise until the
point of failure is reached. The point of failure is interpreted as a lack in energy convergence,
i.e. the system starts to fail if the energy is steadily increased during a bearing load itera-
tion. A simple bearing load iteration can be found in example ase9_quad_euler_beam.dat ,
for cracked concrete also in the verification examples nonlinear_quad_concrete_beam.dat (
nonlinear_quad_concrete_beam.pdf)
Fornon-linearmaterialcalculationsitoftenhappensthatthisautomaticmethoddoesnotreach
adequate equilibrium, due to a lack in normal force convergence, even if the bearing load has
not been reached yet. This can be overcome by entering a negative input for STEP under the
record ULTI. Now the load is continuously increased, even if no convergence is reached after
every individual load step. The user has to be assessed then the systems bearing capacity
according to the energy convergence, the remaining residual forces and the load deflection
curve. Alternatively the procedure could gain stability through the dynamic calculation.
2.13 Membrane Structures: Formfinding and Static Analysis
See also YOUTUBE Video https://youtu.be/EvJuyYhPQKk
and https://youtu.be/AJpfZ995lcs
2.13.1 Overview
Membranestructuresarecharacterizedbytransferringofloadsonlywithnormalforces. Bend-
ing moments and shear forces are not available. The analysis with real membrane elements
is more comfortable and more exactly unlike the simplified processing with a truss model, be-
cause the geometry and the stress state can be generated any exactly.
Membranes should be generated with triangulas elements (SOFIPLUS export triangles).
The first task is the formfinding during the analysis of membrane structures. A corresponding
form is searched for a desired stress state in the membrane. A soap skin is only result here
for the isotropic prestress. Forms which are different to the soap skin need a normal force
distribution which modifies itself about the structure.
Forformfindingwedonotusemassesandnotimestepanalysis,thatmeansnotransientanal-
sis and no dynamic relaxation. You can better use the word ’force density’ but force density
only works on the geometry alone. We (SOFiSTiK) use for formfinding the normal geometric
nonlinear FE analysis with residual force iteration but with nearly zero stiffness in the mem-
brane. That keeps the given stress in the membrane constant (soap film). As the stiffness is
2-50 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
zeroinmembranedirectionweuseadditionalmeshcontroltechniquestoavoidaswimmingof
the nodes on the soap film.
If the membrane form is found, real load cases can be calculated with this new form as initial
system. The membrane must be omitted here for compression. Further textile properties are
realized mostly by a simplified linear- elastic orthotropic material law. So when the membrane
has its normal stiffness e.g. in a final wind analysis, SOFiSTiK makes a normal geometric
nonlinear FE analysis (Newton Raphson and Crisfield or line search residual force iteration).
Edge stiffenings with edge cables, inside cables or compression arches can be considered in
real structures.
2.13.2 The Membrane Element
The membrane element implemented in ASE can be used only for calculations with large
deformations with SYST ... PROB TH3. It is activated with the material input AQUA NMAT
MEMB or with an input in SOFiMSHA...QUAD...NRA=2 (QUAD only with membrane action).
The program configuration levels ASE1-3 are necessary for the material non-linear element
and ASE4 for compression failure.
Membranes should be generated with triangular elements (SOFIPLUS export triangles). The
reason is that quads may get angles > 180 degree in the formfinding (problematic) and that
cannot happen on triangles. And as the nonconforming shape functions are switched off for
membranes, the triangles are as good as 4-noded quads.
Figure2.37: Meshwithtriangularelements=recommended
Properties
The membrane element described here is implemented in the FE program ASE of the
SOFiSTiK AG. It has following properties:
• The membrane element processes only membrane internal forces and moments (NX, NY,
NXY).
• It bears arbitrary large strains and rotations.
• Itbearslargetwistsandtransmitsthemembraneforcesfromthetwistintotherightdirection
(here forces are available perpendicular to the thought element centre area).
• It is possible to use three-noded or four-noded elements for it.
• A prestress can be defined (also orthotropic).
SOFiSTiK2023 2-51ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
• Stress modifications can be suppressed for the formfinding.
• It failures for compression (adjustable).
• Orthotropic material properties can be considered (linear-elastic approximation). For
anisotropic poisson’s ratio see example membrane_poisson_ratio.dat
Figure2.38: Nodalforcesattwisted4-nodedmembraneelement
The stiffness of the membrane element consists of the normal strain stiffness in the element
plane and of a initial stress stiffness from the prestress of the element.
K = K 0+K s (2.47)
Input of the Membrane element
Membrane elements are input like normal shell elements as element type QUAD. If the ele-
ment formulation NRA=2 (see SOFiMSHA-QUAD) is set immediately, the element is marked
as membrane. Otherwise a normal QUAD element can be defined as membrane with a non-
linear material input AQUA NMAT
Non-linear properties can be activated in AQUA with AQUA NMAT MEMB P1 P2.
P1 Yield strength for tension
maximum tensile strength in kN/m in warp and fill direction,
practical e.g. for geo-textiles
The input P1=0.0 is taken as ’no input’.
The old input P1=1.0 is not considered
(P1 was used formerly with another meaning.)
P2 Factor for compression survey
P2=1.0 The membrane can sustain the compression.
P2=0.0 The membrane cannot sustain the compression.
(only reasonable after formfinding)
P2=0.1 Intermediate values are possible, the elastic
modulus is reduced correspondingly for the
compression strains.
In standard cases e.g. for material 5 the input NMAT 5 MEMB
is sufficient to define the most important effect of membranes: no conpression - only tension
(in a mterial nonlinear analysis with ASE SYST NMAT yes).
2-52 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
Nonlinear warp-fill material law
In ASE a "‘Nonlinear yarn-parallel warp-fill behaviour"’ is implement according to: Dr. Cédric
Galliot + Dr. Rolf Luchsinger ’A simple non-linear material model for PVC-coated polyester
fabrics’ Tensinews Newsletter Nr. 18 April 2010
The definition of additional parameters AQUA NMAT MEMB P3+P4 activates this law. The
nonlinear behavior is expressed as a stress-strain relation. This means that for a given stress
sigma-w, sigma-f (w=warp direction, f=fill direction) it gives a corresponding nonlinear strain
eps-w, eps-f. The values of the stress-strain matrix depend on the ratio of sigma-w to sigma-f
using the factors γ  und γ ƒ:

Special Features for the System Input
The system should be already defined, if possible, three-dimensionally with boundary arches.
The boundary cables can be introduced then with full stiffness in the first formfinding step, be-
causetheyhavealreadytherightlength. Thethree-dimensionalinputhasalsotheadvantage,
thatthespancablesandcolumnscanbealreadyinputinthethree-dimensionalsystem. Then
the still inaccurate form of the membrane is smoothed via ”shrinkage” of the membrane - see
formfinding.
Only for systems with high reference point it is reasonable to input the system at first two-
dimensionally, because the input is significantly simpler here. The membrane can be hoisted
then at marked points via nodal point displacements.
Mesh selection
Automatically generated meshes are unproblematic for systems without high reference points.
They should be avoided at high reference points. At high reference points a radially and tan-
gentiallyorientedmeshisnumericallymorestableandopticallymorebeautifulduetotheoften
orthotropic prestress.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-53ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
Mesh macros
Pregenerated macros can be used for high reference points. Macros which are read in such
a way are optimized for the registration of the stress conditions at the high reference points
and delivers a good geometry for high reference points (The distance of the inner elements is
selected deliberately near in the initial system, because they are stretched due to the hoisting
during formfinding).
The macros are placed in the plan, adjusted to the size (stretched) and the remaining mem-
brane area is closed with a normal element mesh.
Boundary cables
Boundary cables should be always defined with the desired final curvature at an arch during
input in the plan - see chapter ”Free Cable Edges defined in the Initial System with Radius”.
Mixed systems
If the membrane should be calculated together with other structural members (walls, pylons,
girders), the input is mostly urgently necessary with three-dimensional initial system.
Prestress and Formfinding
As in outline mentioned in chapter ”Overview”, the prestress is decisive for the formfinding.
Different membrane forms can be generated with different prestressing states.
This phenomenon becomes especially clear for boundary cables: If a boundary cable is more
prestressedforagivenmembraneprestress,alargercableradiuswillresultandthusasmaller
pass of the boundary cable:
Figure2.39: Aboundarycableleftwithsmall,rightwithlargeprestress
At high reference points a too large prestress ties up the ”neck”:
Figure2.40: Leftatoosmall,rightatoolargeprestress
The user has to be known the desired form at the beginning. The pass of the boundary cable
should be used already during the system input. The input FE mesh should include therefore
2-54 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
the boundary cable curvature.
Soap skin
In a soap skin an isotropic prestress is available in all points of the membrane. This prestress
is determined about the surface tension of the liquid for the genuine soap skin.
The strain stiffness disappears here in the mathematical model. The equilibrium results only
fromthethree-dimensionalequilibriumoftheisotropicstresses. Thestiffnessofthemembrane
results to:
K =K σ (2.52)
The stiffness keeps the membrane in its form perpendicularly to the membrane area. Thought
points are freely movable in the plane of the membrane area. For the genuine soap skin the
phenomenon is visible at the blurring of the points (bubbles) on the skin surface.
The in all directions constant prestress is input in ASE with the record GRP ... PREX,PREY
(acts on all element types, also on cables, beams ...).
Constant orthotropic prestress
The direction of effective span is often dominating in one direction for rectangular membrane
areas. Then it is desired to set a larger prestress in this direction than perpendicularly to it.
Nevertheless the prestress is of the same size in all points, if also orthotropically.
Figure2.41: Orthotropicprestress-inlongitudinaldirectionlargerthanintransversedirection
The orthotropic constant prestress is input in ASE either with the record GRP ... PREX,PREY
in local element direction or with the record HIGH with a high reference point distance > 999
m in global direction.
Orthotropic high reference point prestress
Ifgenuinehighreferencepointsareavailableformembranes,theorthotropicprestressisoften
desired with a fixed ratio of tangential/radial prestress in order to avoid a large tying up of the
membrane at the high reference point. A radial stress which increases to the high reference
point is necessary for that.
AsuchaxisymmetricstressstateofthehighreferencepointisgeneratedwithHIGH.Theratio
SOFiSTiK2023 2-55ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
of the tangential to the radial prestress is input with the item PTPR. In dependence on PTPR
the stress increases much or not so much to the high reference point.
Example of a high refence point at X = 5.0 m, Y = 0.0 m:
HIGH X 5.0 Y 0.0 PR1 20 PTPR 0.4 produces:
sig-r in distance of 1m = 20.00 kN/m
sig-t in distance of 1m = 8.00 kN/m (0.4*20)
and due to equilibrium reasons in distance of e.g. 10 m:
sig-r in distance of 10m = PR1*1/r*eˆ(PTPR*ln(r))
= 20*1/10*exp(0.4*ln(10))
= 5.02 kN/m
sig-t in distance of 10m = 2.01 kN/m (0.4*5.02)
see example file: high_point.dat
input: HIGH XM YM ZM NX NY NZ PR1 PTPR NOG
As a default an input for a high reference point has an effect for all QUAD elements, also for
elements which are not a membrane. For mixed systems the prestress is allocated therefore
with NOG to the corresponding group. It is also possible to input some high reference points
per group. The program generates then the average value from the inputs in each element in
dependence on the distance to the different high reference points. In the following example
there are four high points and one low point in a membrane area. The tangential part PTPR
maynotbetoolargeforthehighreferencepoints,becausethemembraneconstrictsitselfand
tears off. The factor PTPR is input therefore different for the five high reference points in this
example.
Figure 2.42: Orthotropic high reference point prestress with some high reference points ( mem-
bran5.dat)
If the distance is larger than 1000 m, the constant prestress is assumed with a stress in di-
rection to the high reference point always of PR1 and a stress perpendicularly to it always of
PTPR·PR1 and therefore without radial reduction. The advantage of this input is the simple
definition of skewed prestress independently on the direction of the local element coordinate
systems! The stress in the QUAD elements results from the global directions!
Elastic skin

Amembranecanbedefinedfromthebeginningwiththerealstiffnessandcanbehoistedfrom
the plane initial system at the high reference points or at the boundary cables. It results then
large stresses in direction to the high reference points in dependence on the material proper-
ties. Theycanbescaled,however,byusingthisstatewiththegroupfactorsFACL+FACS.The
use of a elastic skin formfinding is described in chapter ”Unstable Membrane Forms”.
Input of the Prestress for Different Groups
Definition in different groups
Formembraneanalysesthesystemhastobegotalreadyinthefirststepaninformationabout
a prestress in the elements, because otherwise the system is unstable - the stiffness is zero
perpendicularly to the membrane without prestress! A load prestress is still not considered for
the system stiffness. The prestress has to be input therefore with GRP or HIGH.
The different elements of the structure like:
• membrane areas
• boundary cables
• structural cables
• pylones and other beams
• massive support elements (concrete walls ...)
are defined in different groups and can get thus different prestresses from GRP and HIGH.
If different radii in boundary cables should be kept exactly (formfinding also for boundary ca-
bles), then also the boundary cables should be defined in different groups. If the boundary
radii were already input graphically (is absolutely recommended), it is possible to refrain the
exactinputoftheboundarycableprestress,becausetheboundarycableforceresultsfromthe
radius and the membrane prestress during the formfinding.
Criteria for the Input of the Prestress
Free cable edges (free membrane edges reinforced with cables) should be input already as
arch with the desired curvature radius in the initial system. The radius is preset in any case by
the architect. If the boundary cable is defined as line in the initial system and the final edge
circle should be determined by the program, then impermissible element angles are often
available due to the distorsions. The iterations are much faster and clearer, if the edge arch
has approximately the final position already in the initial system.
The prestress which should be input for the boundary cable results to:
cable force = membrane force radius P = n · r
It is to be noted, that physical impermissible inputs do not arise. Unconsistent inputs can
arise especially at the connection points of cables. In the following example an equilibrium is
possible without an angle of the cable forces, because P1 > P2+P3+P4.

2.13.3 Formfinding
System Definition - Two Options
The initial structure can be defined with two options for the formfinding:
• Definition of a three-dimensional initial system with at first plane partial areas: The bound-
ary points of the structure are input three-dimensionally. The remaining areas are defined
e.g. as folded structure. The program takes over the formfinding of the inner area.
• Definition of a plane initial system: The structure is input two-dimensionally. At arbitrary
points the structure is ”hoisted” then at support nodes.

Figure2.44: Three-dimensionalinitialsystem-angle
The membrane prestress is defined isotropic with GRP ... SIGX SIGY in kN/m during the
formfinding step. Because the strains should not lead to stress modifications due to the
formfinding, the element stiffness is set almost to 0: GRP FACS=1E-10. The QUAD elements
with the material number 1 are defined as membrane elements ( AQUA NMAT 1 MEMB). ASE

have 10 kN/m in x direction, however, only 5 kN/m in y direction! Thus a first estimated cable
force of P = n · r with a membrane force n=10 kN/m perpendicular to the cable results (group
2: N = 16m· 10 kN/m = 160 kN).

Because the displacement picture is not different for load case1 and 2, only the final result of
load case 2 is shown here:
Figure2.48: Foundformwithprestress+deadload
Free cable edges defined straightly in initial system
Example angle, example file simple_angle2.dat.
Such a process should be avoided, because the QUAD elements are deformed possibly im-
permissible during the deformation of the boundary cable. This distortion and rotation of the
QUAD elements is very unfavourable for orthotropic prestress, because the local coordinate
system of the elements and the direction of the orthotropic prestress are turned.
Followingexampleshoulddemonstrateneverthelessthepossibilityoftheformfindingforcable

upper boundary is defined as free edge (without support conditions) and a boundary cable is
generatedattheboundarynodes. Themembraneisdefinedingroup0andthecableingroup

The iteration is very fast for the system and the result is reasonable, because boundary cable
curvature does not distort the QUAD elements. The cable radius is resulted always according
to following formula:
cable force = membrane force · radius P = n · r
or r = P / n = 8 kN / 2 kN/m = 4 m

Without additional elements like columns it is possible to define systems in plane and to hoist
at corners. Only corner nodes in the plane, boundary cables with desired edge radii as well
as meshes which are hooked in are generated here. The system is simple hoisted then at the
corner nodes about the support displacements. The membrane becomes mostly a soap skin
prestress which is input with GRP ... PREX,PREY. The boundary cables have mostly a fixed
radius. The first estimation of the prestress of the boundary edges results from the membrane
force multiplied by this radius.

The formfinding which begins with a plane initial mesh is to be seen also very well for another
example with four high points and one low point. The system is here also generated very fast
in the plane by copying the high reference point macro (example file membran5.dat).
Mesh Control
It exists the danger in the formfinding step, that the nodal points become blurred in the mem-
brane plane. In order to avoid that, a so-called mesh control relaxes (optimizes) the mesh of
the inner membrane nodse - see CTRL ... FIXZ.
Saving of the Found Form
If the formfinding is completed, it is basically possible to put always on the found form with
SYST PLC for further calculations. A result representation with WinGRAF is actually always
desired at the formfinding system. In addition it is desired, that the ANIMATOR lets swing
e.g. the deformations from wind in relation to the formfinding system. Without further control,
however, the ANIMATOR would swing between the input system and the system deformed by
thewind. Inadditionanewselectionofthelocalcoordinatesystemofthemembraneelements
is sometimes reasonable, if e.g. a fibre direction of the cloth should be defined from the high
reference point.

Formfinding with Loading
The dead load of the construction was input during formfinding already in the example of the
standroofing. Thefoundformliesthenalittledeeperasthepuremembraneformwithoutdead
load. The effect does not strike for a small dead load. Also the boundary cable is very light.
It is also possible to search deliberately a form with consideration of an outside loading, e.g.
with constant internal pressure (air pressure).
An internal pressure of 2 kN/m2 is used during the formfinding in the example sim-
ple_angle.dat. The membrane prestress is selected with 2 kN/m2. The air pressure ist best
applied via VOLU as this load updates the load direction during the iteration see example
air_volume_tennis.dat and air_volume_sphere.dat
The membrane eigenstiffness is switched off again in the formfinding load case 11 in order to
prevent stress modifications in the membrane force due to strains. The load case 11 shows
following deformation picture:
Figure2.54: Exampleanglewithinternalpressure
2-66 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
Figure2.55: loadcase11loadcase12Anglewithinternalpressure
Thelowerpictureshowstheformfindingofacompressedairtennishallbeginningwithaplane
mesh. The calculation as ideal soap skin results here in a curios corner generation. Real
tennis halls leave mostly the ideal soap skin form for the benefit of a better space utilization in
the corner with the disadvantage of an orthotrop stress distribution with disturbance areas in
the corner.
Figure2.56: Tennishall: pumpingupofasoapskinwithplaneinitialsystem- tennis.dat
A further example for formfinding with internal pressure is to be found in six_corners.dat:
Figure 2.57: Hexagon: pumping up of a spherical shell six_corners.dat and
air_volume_sphere.dat
Load Direction and Load Area
Without VOLU and using an inner air pressure from SOFILOAD, an update of the loading
with a following formfinding step with the same load is urgently necessary, because then the
conversion of the load into nodal loads can be done only on basis of the element geometry
of the primary load case. On the one hand load direction changes and on the other hand the
SOFiSTiK2023 2-67ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
element areas (air pressure area) changes see example air_volume_tennis.dat
For all element loading from SOFILOAD it is generally valid: The load is converted into nodal
loadsatthesystemoftheprimaryloadcase. Deformationsofthecurrentcalculatedloadcase
do not twist the load anymore. It has to be calculated therefore always with small load steps
and with a new setting up onto a primary load case also for a girder which is designed for
buckling,ife.g. theloadshouldbetwistedtothelocalzaxisofthebeaminconformitywiththe
beam rotations!
Formfinding for Compression Arch Shells
Theformwhichisfoundwiththesoapskinande.g. usingnegativedeadloadcanbeusedalso
asinitialsystemforacompressionshell. Inthiscasetheelementthicknessesandthematerial
parameters can be redefined after formfinding and the membrane elements can be converted
into normal shell elements which can carry then the positive dead load and the real loads with
compressive forces, bending moments and shear forces. In SOFiMSHA the definition NRA=2
may not be input. The switching over from the membrane to the concrete is done with a first
AQUAcalculationwithAQUAMAT+NMATMEMBfortheformfinding. ThenthematerialCONC
is redefined with a following AQUA calculation.
2.13.4 Static Analysis
In general the formfinding is only a first step during the calculation of membrane structures.
Theloadingwindandsnowwhichisessentiallyforthedesignofthebuildingstructuremustbe
carried by the system which is determined during formfinding. The snow load can be defined
mostly very simple. The wind load, however, depends on the height, position and direction of
the single element.
Generation of the Wind Load
If the possibilities for the input of the wind load are not sufficient in SOFiMSHA, the wind load
can be defined also as block load: example membrane_compression.dat . With a little more
expenditure the wind load can be input also as a function of the height in dependence on the
position with angle functions.

printout of the local z axis (normal) can be done in ASE with ECHO ELEM 4. If the list is read

Then each element get its own local loading. A system has not to be calculated using ECHO
ELEM 4 in an ASE calculation - CTRL SOLV 0 can be input here. The output values refer to
the system which was displaced possibly with the primary load case SYST ... PLC. Following

Wind pressure till compression failure
The tensile stresses due to the prestress can not be sufficient for large wind forces in the
reality. Further compressive strains lead to folds in the membrane. They have, however, no
influenceonthestructuralbehaviourforthesespecialcases. Thesystemismostlystablealso
withfolds. TheprogramASEcanrealizedtheloadtransferwhichexistsherewithswitchingoff
of the compressive stresses.
A wind pressure from below which uses the prestress in transverse direction up is used in the
example stand roofing ( roof.dat). It would produce therefore folds in reality. At first the system
is updated in the calculation by setting up onto formfinding load case 2:

Obviously the large tangential stress cords up the bottleneck (PTPR=0.50) so strong, that the
membrane or soap skin collapses.
The phenomenon keeps on being examined at following example. A membrane structure is
generated again in the plane. The high reference points are not discretized here - a upper
rigid ring which can be displaced constantly upwards about a support spring is accepted. An
isotropic prestress = formfinding of a soap skin is defined.

The formfinding with 4 m ring lifting has a still stable form:
Figure2.63: Initialsystemthree-dim. representationMembranehoisted4m
Duetoafurtherliftingtheneckcordsupalwaysmoreduringthexyzcompensationcalculation.
By looking at the picture for 4 m lifting the closing forces of the defined membrane prestress
in ring direction can be already seen at the bottleneck. The calculation for 7 m lifting is only
convergent, if the elements get a residual stiffness with FACS 0.005. The following pictures
do not show any correct membrane stress state, but they point out at an unstable formfinding
process:
Figure2.64: Membran7mhochgezogenWeiteriteriert7m
This effect can be shown at a soap skin which should be hoisted with a small ring. After a
critical height the soap skin constricts itself and is detached suddenly.
Following process is trusted by the human eye: The stress modification due to strains are not
suppressed anymore but they are allowed. The stress in the ring area increases due to the
lifting of the inner rings. The usual picture of a deformed soap skin (or of tights which are
tensed over the initial mesh) results thereby.

Figure2.65: Elasticmesh1mtill6mhoisted
2.13.6 Calculations of Cable Meshes
With the same methods formfindings can be done also for cable meshes. Discrete cable el-
ements are defined here instead of the membrane. As for the membrane the cable elements
can be used either as elements with constant prestress and known length or as elements with
full strain stiffness and planned initial length. Latter one is mostly desired for the simpler fill-
ing measuring of single cables with the same length. But it leads to distortions in the grid in
the plane projection of the displaced mesh. The lower picture shows the concept design of a
footbridge which is supported on a cable mesh - it is a research paper for the bridging of the
railway station place in Braunschweig.
At first the system is patitioned in an element grid in the plane with cables of the same length.
Theboundaryarchesareconnectedatfirstatanapproximateform. Inthefollowingformfinding
stepsinwhichthecornerpointsofthemesharecompulsorydisplacedintothedesiredvertical
position the boundary cables were defined at first as very elastic. That means they might
change their length arbitrarily, while the inner cables were defined with normal strain stiffness,
because they should not change their position. The four cables which are generated around
the inner deep points as well as single cables in the nearness are an exception. They have
to be defined also partially elastically in order to get a sufficient lowering of the deep points
and thus a double curvature of the cable mesh. These during formfinding more elastic inner
cables have to be produced and installed therefore with a larger length. Foremost the double
curvature of a membrane or of a mesh creates, however, the possibility to carry outer loads
without larger deformations. The stability becomes thereby clearly better also for the dynamic
vibration inclination.
The point-wise loading due to the footbridge which is not shown here leads to a further local
subsidence of the cable mesh. This is, however, favourably for the stability.
The compliance with a structure clearance for the lower street (shown in the side view) which
SOFiSTiK2023 2-73ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
is necessary also during load action was decisive for the concept design.

2.13.7 Check List - Notes - Problem Solutions
System input:
• Ifpossible,thesystemshouldbealreadydefinedthree-dimensionallywithboundaryarches
(set local coordinate system for the arches). The boundary cables can be used then with
the full stiffness in the first formfinding step, because they have already the correct length.
The three-dimensional input has the advantage that the span cables and the columns can
be already defined in the three-dimensional system. Then the still inaccurate form should
be smoothed by ”shrinkage” of the membrane - see -> Formfinding.
• Without staying construction it is also possible to input the system in plane. Foremost then
the system is hoisted by using the support displacements. In this way corrections of the
height position are possible. The input of the boundary arches is indeed simpler. Because
the cable length of a boundary arch becomes clearly longer during lifting, the first step has
to be done with elastic cables (FACS 0.001).

• Usage of macros which are like a spider net for modelling of the high reference points

• AprestressmaynotbeinputatGRP...,becauseitwouldbeaddedtotheprimarystresses.
Exception: The primary stresses are not used with GRP ... FACL=0.
• GRP ... FACL=1 (default) adopts the primary stresses. So that they are in equilibrium
with the applied loads, the external loads like dead load, internal pressure or wind load
have to be used again and again. Exception: Constraint loads like support displacements,
temperature or prestress loads, because they are not external loads.
Static loading:
• For problems with the convergence the loading (wind) should be used with a small factor
and then further increase of the load after setting up onto this convergent state as primary
state.
Problems during iterations:
• Astablesystemisreported,thencalculateonlyoneiterationstepwithCTRL... ITER1and
check the displacements with the ANIMATOR (first step force density method)
• Do not input the factor GRP ... FACS for the cables too small (better FACS=0.01) or calcu-
late it with CTRL ITER 3 V2 1
• If the cables are set with full stiffness in the first formfinding but the membrane elastically
, iteration problems may be available - then use the cable stiffness with FACS 0.01. It is
better set the boundary curvatures with preset cable prestresses.

2.14.1 Introduction
In earlier applications a straight beam was bent on SYST PROB TH3 into a curved shape see
Fig. 2.67 (group 1 in example active_bending_overview.dat).
As a result, we got a stressed bended beam. The curvature 1/r corresponds to the bending
moment M:

and you only give the beam chain the information that it originally was straight, see Fig. 2.68.
InafirststepASEcalculatesthecurvatureofthecurvedinputbeamchainandthenappliesan
internal bending prestress that corresponds to this input curvature. This prestress would like
to bend back the beam chain into a straight shape.
The input shape must not be totally correct.The beam will push itself automatically into an
equilibrium active bending shape. In the following picture the beam behind is the just up-
bended beam (group 1), the middle beam (group 2) has already got the final input shape in
SOFIMSHA, the front beam (group 3) starts with a circular input geometry. In Fig. 2.69 left we
see the result without ACTB input, then group 2+3 are stress-free. The result with input ACTB
for groups 2+3 is shown on the right. Then all three beams end in the same stressed shape
and bending moment, see Fig. 2.70:

2.14.2 Active Bending including a membrane
The new method ACTB now gives us the chance to easily insert a membrane. In the example
active_bending_membrane.dat we start only with a rough desired architectural form in the
graphical input SOFIPLUS and immediately insert a formfinding membrane. The curvatures
mustnotbeexactinthisinputsystem. Sotheupperpartwiththemembranewasinputina45

plane)
With the special input ACTB, we specify now that the beam originated from a straight beam
andsothesystemnearlyplayfullyiteratestoitsstabilityshape. Duetothebottomrestraint,the
beams pull up and tension the anchorage cable. As the membrane is defined as a soap film
withgivenprestress,itfindsastress-constantformaswell,seeFig. 2.73. Thebottomcableof
the membrane can be input with a given length.
Figure2.73: ResultofformfindingwithACTBGRP2onbeamchain(membrane+cableasusual)
Torsion: caused by the anchorage cable a slight torsion is induced compared to fig. 2.83.
Depending on the torsional restraint at the bottom the system is more or less flexible against
this horizontal loading of the anchorage cable.
To check if the active bending moment is correctly introduced in the curved input system, we
now let the beam relax. For this we switch off the membrane and the cable and cut the beam
intoshorterpieces. Withthiswestartadynamicrelaxationandasaresultwereallygetstraight
pieces, see Fig. 2.74.

The system is rather flexible and would swing or flutter on wind. Without wind it is stable, but
the first buckling eigenfrequency is only a little bit greater than 1.0. Now it is easy to use the
system several times: Fig. 2.75.

With a four-node quad meshing, quads could be created at the kink with three nodes attached
to an active bending beam, one node before the kink, one at the kink and one behind.

Iftheactivebendingbeamthengetsnearlystraight,atthekinkanangleofnearly180degrees

Therefore, a triangle meshing is used here. As in membrane elements the nonconforming
shapefunctionsofafour-nodequadareswitchedoff,theuseoftriangleelementsissufficient.
Torsion: the rotation of the main active bending plane causes a slight torsion. But as the rod
can nearly rotate free in the membrane pocket, the active bending beam withdraws himself as
goodaspossiblefromtorsion. Onlyincasethefrictioninthemembranepocketishighe.g. for
a windsurf mast, a significant torsion may be induced on wind loading.
Example active_bending_sphere.dat demonstrates how to reach various final shapes with
different prestress input, see Fig. 2.77. Also in this example file the dynamic relaxation is
checked successful.
Figure 2.77: Sphere: left input system, middle: upper areas prestressed higher, right : vertical
areasstressedhigher
Torsion: here no torsion appears in the building stage. The bending always acts in one plane.
Vertical to this plane no shear force appears (disregarding of little gravity loading in the upper
plane).
2.14.4 Torsion case study
If we bend a straight beam with a cable into an active bending shape and then apply a hori-
zontal force at the cantilever, we would first think a torsional moment at the bottom support is
gnerated, see Fig. 2.78
+
Figure2.78: Torsioncasestudy
In the following we demonstrate, that no torsional moment will appear in this case. Please
SOFiSTiK2023 2-81ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
notice that we can also start to bend the beam backward or under 30 degrees, see Fig. 2.79
Figure2.79: leftstartingsystem,thenbendto+x,under30degreesorbackward(-y)
The amount of energy is the same for all three cases. Therefore a horizontal deformation of
the head should not activate additional energy in the system. But this would mean that the
system is unstable regarding rotation around the z axis. But the beam is fixed at the bottom -
so this should not be the case.
But it is - with a horizontal deformation the beam just rolls away without a force into the new
position, see Fig. 2.80 (at least theoretically). This happens for a perfect round beam, while
the cable must be attached at the cross section center of the beam. In reality a beam is never
perfect round - it will always bend into a favored direction.
Figure2.80: Horizontaldeformationofthecantilever-thebeamjustrollsawaywithoutforce
We (the SOFiSTiK team) have build a real model and proved that the beam really rolls away
and no torsion appears, see YOUTUBE video with search term ’active bending torsion beam’.
You can also compare the behavior with a tube-cleaning-spiral that you twist at one end. Also
in case the spiral goes around in curves, you can twist it nearly without effort if the end of the
spiral and the spiral in between is not fixed against rotation.
2-82 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
Conclusion: on many deformations and loadings an active bending beam just rolls away or
rotates and withdraws itself from torsion.
2.14.5 Torsion on beam with fixed ends
So we use a beam with restrained ends in example active_bending_torsion_mtfixed.dat ac-
cording Fig. 2.81 - then we can introduce a torsion. To test it, we first bend a straight beam
to a half circle (also requires bending moment at the end of the beam) and then apply torsion.
Accordingly, we rotate the left support left and the right support also left. As a result we get a
constant torsion in the beam.
MY MT
Figure2.81: left: bendupastraightbeamtoahalfcircleandtorsioned: center: MYright: MT
Under torsion, little horizontal deformations occur vertical to the circle plane. If we now freeze
the system and store it (ASE: SYST STIOR YES) and then start the active bending procedure
with ACTB GRP 1 MEND ’FIX’ MT ’FIX’ on the stress-free updated system, we get a torsion
in the beam - as in the original system. In the active bending routine this is created with a
rotational check that recognizes a torsion via the little horizontal deformations. You only have
to tell the program that the active bending beam is restrained at both ends and that at both
ends torsion can be applied (MEND ’FIX’ MT ’FIX’). Otherwise, ASE assumes that the beam
does not have bending or torsional moments at both ends - as in the first example.
2.14.6 No torsion in case of constant beam rotation
If we rotate both ends in opposite direction, so the left to the left and the right to the right,
we can rotate the beam without energy. The whole beam just rotates away, see Fig. 2.82.
This happens because the active bending beam originally came from a straight beam and the
stress-free length of the inner fiber has the same length as the outer fiber.
SOFiSTiK2023 2-83ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
Figure 2.82: bend up a straight beam to a half circle and torsioned contraverse: no torsion MT
appears
This would not happen in case of a stress-free half circle - it has a shorter inner fibre and a
longer outer fibre. A torsion would require energy.
So again we see: it is not so easy to get torsion into an active bending beam.
2.14.7 Torsion caused by loading transverse to the main active bending plane
If we take the stressed system from the previous chapter and apply a horizontal force on top,
see fig. 2.83, the load and the induced shear force acts transverse to the main active bending
plane and we get a torsional moment MT. Depending on the torsional restraint at the bottom
the system is more or less flexible for this transverse loading.
Figure2.83: MTforloadingtransversetomainplane: middlefull,righttorsionfreebottomfixing
If we take the so deformed system as a starting input system for an ACTB analysis, ASE can
extract a torsion-MT-prestress out of the rotation of the main curvature planes, see 2.84, refer
to input ACTB-MT.
2-84 SOFiSTiK2023TheoreticalPrinciples|ASE
Figure2.84: MTforloadingtransversetomainplane: middlefull,righttorsionfreebottomfixing
But the material stress is small compared to the bending stress. In the example of fig. 2.72
max-tau-MT is less than 0.1% in relation to the maximum bending stress.
2.15 Dynamic Modal Analysis
For dynamic eigenvalues there are two main analysis methods available:
1. Direkt method according to Lanczos
2. Simultaneous inverse vector iteration
ThemethodaccordingtoLanczosisusuallyalwaysthequickestone. Especiallyinthecaseof
many eigenvalues (more than 10) it is the only practical method. The number of the required
eigenvaluesdependsinturnontheexpectedexcitationfrequencies. Thesimultaneousinverse
vector iteration should be used, if the interest is limited to a few eigenvalues only or if a check
of the number of eigenvalues below a certain frequency is required (Sturm sequence).
The modal shapes are saved like regular load cases. They can be further processed as de-
sired, and then they can be used chiefly with the program DYNA for a dynamic analysis.
For the simultaneous vector iteration the higher eigenvalues converge much more worse than
the lower. Therefore it is reasonable, if enough memory is available, to iterate a few more vec-
torsthanoneneeds. Themethodis,however,inappropriateforalargenumberofeigenvalues.
The number of iterations is predetermined by the program. If the convergence is slow, one
should switch generally to the Lanczos method instead of increasing the number of iterations.
The iteration is interrupted, if the number of the maximum iterations is reached or if the max-
imum eigenvalue has changed only by the factor less than 0.00001 opposite to the previous
iteration.
For the method according to Lanczos the number of the Lanczos vectors should be selected
usually twice so large as the number of the desired eigenvalues. An iteration is not necessary
in this case.
Example see ase4_eigenfrequencies.dat
SOFiSTiK2023 2-85ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
Activated mass:
ASE prints three types of activated mass in the output:
1. on earthquake activated effective modal mass X(t) Y(t) Z(t) X(%)...
Thesumofpercentageofalleigenvaluesshouldreachabout100%. Butthefirsteigenform
in the above shown tuning fork will give no contribution, because the two legs always swing
in the opposite direction. The first eigenform will not be activated by earthquake.
2. activated or generalized modal mass (%)*
This is not relevant for an earthquake analysis but gives the best results for a tuning fork or
the rotational modes of a building. For the tuning fork the first eigenform will have the
biggest activated mass as most of the mass moves. The sum of percentage is now not
limited to 100 % (a one mass swinger will have 100 % in every global X,Y,Z direction).
See: SchwingungsbemessungvonDecken-RWTHAachenRFS2-CT-2007-00033page31
3. Rotation aroud the system center S (%)
is calculated similar to the effective modal mass but with the rotation around the system
center S and the distance to it:
(sm(m∗r∗_tngent))/rm2/sm(m)
(2.55)
with mass, r=distance to the system center,
rm=average radius = sum(r*m) /sum(m)
- a critical earthquake eigenform has high values in ’effective modal mass’
- an inner eigenform like a tuning fork torque has high values in ’activated mass’
- torsional eigenforms have high values in ’rotation around S’

dead weight can be output with ECHO LOAD EXTR.
A conversion of loads to masses can occur with the record MASS LC.

In time step analysis additional masses are applied as dynamic mass and on LC...DLZ 1 also
immediately also as static load, see a1_introduction_earthquake.dat
2.18 Damping Elements
Damping values e.g. in spring elements are considered for the time-step method.
Example see spring_with_damping.dat
exponential: springdampexpo.dat
2.19 Modal Damping and Modal Loads
The modal damping dj is defined as a product of the modal shape i multiplied by the damp-
ing matrix multiplied by the modal shape j. This matrix is not generally diagonal. However,
ASE calculates only the diagonal terms of this matrix and saves them as modal damping val-
ues. Different damping of the individual modal shapes can be calculated easily in this way by
specifying different damping for particular element groups.
For evaluation of modal load, SOFILOAD can multiply a loadvector of an ASE loadcase e.g. 3
with an eigenform e.g. lc 1004 (SOFILOAD: LC 3 rest ; EVAL RU no 1004).
2.20 Dynamic analysis possibilities
See also YOUTUBE Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1W6xUmH4xk
DYNA is the specialist for modal analyis and linear dynamics.
In ASE usually nonlinear dynamic is calculated in a time step analysis.
Inanonlineartimestepanalysisthecompletestressstateincludingdeadloadmustbegener-
SOFiSTiK2023 2-87ASE|TheoreticalPrinciples
ated. It is best to calculate the steady state g_1+g_2 already nonlinear but statically and then
uses this static state as primary loadcase for the nonlinear time step analysis.
As ASE calculates each time step separate we get the opportunity to adjust the
load to the developing displacements. Such an intelligent load is shown in example
step_intelligent_load.dat:
Method 1 we apply a fixed predefined sinus wave.
Problem: we cannot be shure that the system really reacts exactly in the same
frequency as the load frequency. Especially with nonlinear effects or moving
mass the system frequency will change and the fixed load frequency will not
remain in resonance.
Method 2 the intelligend load method applies the positive load only in case a controlling
node goes down and applies a negative load in case the node goes up. So the
load is always pushing the system like on a swing and remains in resonance.
Problem: inmethod2thisgivesablockloadandlittlepeakaccelerationsonthe
load jump.
Method 3 we start a sinus wave cycle when the controlling node jumps from going up to
going down. When the next change comes, the next sinus wave is triggered.
The length of the sinus wave starts with an estimated value and is adjusted in
dependance of the cycles.
An overview to the possibilities with remarks and examples can be found in
a1_dynamic_overview.dat

3.1 Input Language
The input is made in the CADINP language (see general manual SOFiSTiK: ’Basics’).
Three categories of units are distinguished:
mm Fixed unit. Input is always required in the specified unit.
[mm] Explicit unit. Input defaults to the specified unit. Alternatively, an explicit as-
signment of a related unit is possible (eg. 2.5[m] ).
[mm] Implicit unit. Implicit units are categorised semantically and denoted by a cor-
1011
responding identity number (shown in green). Valid categories referring to the
unit ”length” are, for example, geodetic elevation, section length and thickness.
Thedefaultunitforeachcategoryisdefinedbythecurrentlyactive(designcode

specified unit in square brackets corresponds to the default for unit set 5 (Eu-
rocodes, NORM UNIT 5).

3.2 Input Records
The statical system is input with a graphic input program or with the program SOFIMSHA/-
SOFIMSHC. Material values can be modified, however, in ASE.
The input is divided into blocks which are terminated with an END record. A particular sys-

ForsolvingtheequationsystemsoftheFinite-Elementproblem,SOFiSTiKprovidesanumber
of solvers. Which solver is used best depends highly on the type of the system and requires
knowledge of relevant system parameters. Following types are available:
• Direct Skyline Solver (Gauss/Cholesky)
This is the classical solver of the FE-Method. The current implementation works best on
a skyline oriented matrix. The storage needed depends on the internal optimization of the
node numbers and may become quite large for 3D structures.
• Iterative Solver (Conjugate Gradients)
One advantage of the iterative solver lies in its reduced requirements for storage, but it
may also provide reduced computing time compared to the previous two types especially
in case of large volume structures.
• Direct Sparse Solver
These types of solvers correspond to state of technology. A quite efficient version based
on the work of Davis [27] is available as well as a direct parallel solver PARDISO.
The advantage of the direct solvers is especially given in case of multiple right hand sides, as
theeffortforsolvingthemisverysmallcomparedtothetriangulizationoftheequationsystem.
Thus they are the first choice for any dynamic analysis or in case of many load cases.

a license of type ”HISOLV”. More information about parallelization can be found in subsec-

• Incomplete Cholesky (V4=1)

to a full triangulization with the Cholesky method, the Incomplete Cholesky saves time by
ignoring the so called Fill-In during decomposition.
• Incomplete Inverse (V4=2)
This type of preconditioning is generally inferior to the Cholesky method. This applies to
the convergence-rate as well as the time required for computing the inverses. It shows
however better performance in case of more densely populated matrices (Recommended
threshold V5: 0.01).
Foranykindofpreconditioningthenumberofmatrixentriestakenintoaccountduringprecon-
ditioning can be reduced either by giving a relative threshold value at V5 or via a maximum

tion, availability of an adequate SOFiSTiK license is obligatory.
Hint
Parallel computing requires availability of a HISOLV license (ISOL granule).
Number of available threads for parallel computing
If parallel computing is active, the number of adopted threads is determined as follows (listed
with increasing priority):
a) The software retrieves the information about the number of available physical processor
cores on the system. This number defines the default number of threads that are used
when a parallel computation is activated.
b) This default can be modified via the environment variable SOF_NUM_THREADS, which is
also available as sofistik.def parameter.
c) Finally, an explicit statement CTRL CORE NN (or as relative input CTRL CORE NN[%])
temporarily assigns the number of available threads for the respective run.
Hint
Neither option b) nor option c) state an explicit parallel computation request. The deci-
sionif a parallelcomputation istriggered, dependson theactual analysisoption (parallel
processing must be supported for the specific task) and the availability of an adequate
license. Parallel computing can be suppressed by explitly setting the number of available
threads to 1 (or 0).

Comments on updated stiffness:
ASE does not make a new material nonlinear stiffness for quads and brics but only iterates
residual forces. Workflow:
- calculate the nonlinear forces that every quad carries according the actual displacements
- builds the total force sum that all quads and elements can carry
- compares it with the external load
- gets a difference = residual force
- adjustes the displacements according a Chrisfield acceleration or Linesearch acceleration
- goes back to “calculate the forces” until equilibrium is reached

3.3.5 SPRI Spring options
+1 and +8: Consideration of the eccentricity of springs.
Coupling spring elements can account for the real distance of the nodes with an implicit KP
kinematic constraint. A transverse spring force will transfer a moment to the nodes. Without
+1 and +8 the transverse force is transported without a moment - which is mechanically not
correct, Fig. 3.1.
Left with CTRL SPRI 0: the transverse spring transports the force down without creating a
bending moment (M=0).
Right with CTRL SPRI - (default) with the excentricity a correct moment is generated:

Figure3.1: Bendingmomentequilibrium: leftCTRLSPRI0(M=0)-rightCTRLSPRIdefault
YoucanbestillustratetheeffectofCTRLSPRI1ifyouassumethateachashortverticalbeam
goes up to the middle. The transverse spring then connects the ends of these beams and
works like a horizontal spring without excentricity. Then you clearly see that the transverse
spring force creates a bending moment in the beam = spring force * half distance:

+4: direction change of coupling springs.
0/4 pure 0: do NOT apply excentricity of springs from real distance, couplings springs
behave like a truss and can change the force direction

senseful on TH3 (coupling spring keep their direction)

V2 With CTRL SPRI V2=2 the shift of the zeropoint of the work law curve after plasti-
fication (=hysteresis) can be switched off. This is senseful for work law curves that
shall simulate a gap. V2 not equal 2 = with hysteresis.

W5 With default V5=3 the offset moment due to a transverse displacement of a spring
is taken into account for a roller bearing (contact in the middle).
This offset moment can only be applied if the spring has also a CT transverse stiff-
ness. So in case you need this offset moment please at least input a small CT
transverse stiffness, e.g. CT 0.001.

The length of the decreasing part of the concrete stress-strain curve in the tensile zone is
defined with CTRL CONC VAL:

VAL 0 The length is determined from the tensilefailure energy. This energy is not limited
with 5·eps1 as in the default (without an input for CTRL CONC).
CTRL CONC V2: the increase of the maximum concrete compressive stress for uniaxial com-
pression according to Kupfer/Rüsch is deactivated as a precaution for calculations according
to ultimate limit state:
V2 0 no limitation, increase permissible, default for NSTR KSV SL, SLD
V2 1 maximum concrete compressive stress = 1.0 · value from uniaxial AQUA stress-

Input per cent e.g. :
CTRL CONC V6 85 = max. reduction 85%
CTRL CONC V6 100 = no reduction
default V6=75 (refer to BEMESS CTRL TENS)
V7 Computation on singular support points in the material nonlinear concrete analysis
(SYST NMAT YES):
Problem: such singular supports caused singular forces that could not be carried
in the concrete nonlinear material model, especially in combination with singular
rotational constraints.
At punching nodes from BEMESS now a first singular support or connection force
(and bending moment) will be distributed on neighbouring nodes inside the column
perimeter to simulate a constant distributed support pressure. Thus the feature
only works after a BEMESS ultmate design with PUNC YES or PUNC CHEK! The
support force of the center is distributed via an internal coupling ring around the
center node and elastic springs to further nodes inside the column area.
The processing is documented in the statistik print out "rounding singular punching
nodes". It can be switched off with CTRL CONC V7 0. It only works on BEMESS
punching nodes but also if they come from beam connections in a 3D analysis.
It also converts singular connection bending moments in a triangular connection

pressure. The effect can be studied well by comparing a run with CTRL CONC V7
0andarunwithCTRLCONCV71. Especiallyatfinediscretizedpunchingpointsa
rotational constraints will be analyzed more realistic (stronger). On such points the
singular support moment caused a strong singular curvature in the fine mesh and
thus a lower constraint.

3.3.14 FRIC Maximum allowable shear stress for the QUAD concrete rule
For point supported slabs the allowable shear stress is exceeded often in support-near ele-
ments. It results in shear plastification. For this shear plastification the punching information
of BEMESS is taken into account in a non-linear slab analysis. At punching node, the shear
plasticity check will be switched off inside an radius of column-edge+hm. Thus an increase of
FRIC to for example 9.9 N/mm2 for elimination of these sometimes unwanted shear plastifica-
tion effects is only necessary in special cases.

3.3.15 STII Linear beam stiffness factor in a nonlinear analysis
T-beams(beams)arecalculatedlinearinanormalnon-linearslabcalculationwithSYSTNMAT
YES (without NSTR S1). In this case an overall reduction of the beam stiffness is done. The
inputCTRLSTII0.4forexampleprocessesconcretebeamswith40%stiffness. Anormalforce
stiffness is not used then. For slab calculations (program SOFIMSHA/SOFIMSHC ... SYST
GIRD) according to cracked condition STII is preset with 0.25 (0.75*1/(1+phi) with phi=2.0)..
The default is 1.0 for all other calculations. Steel beams or beams with other material than
concrete are not influenced.
Using nonlinear T-beams in combination with a quad slab is problematic due to the change
of centre of stiffness in cracked beams and the elongation of beams due to crack open-
ing. In such a case it is better to use only excentric quad elements as shown in example
csm32_slab_design.dat
3.3.16 PLAB T-beam philosophy
The plate components are deducted automatically during the stiffness calculation for beams
insideplateswithcrosssectionwidthsdefinedintheprogramAQUA.Thedeadloadisadjusted
to avoid double dead load. The components of the plate internal forces are added then to the
results of the beam internal forces for a subsequent dimensioning.
(is not valid in method with excentric beams see TBEX)
Restrictions:
• Processingonlyforcrosssectionswithdefinedcrosssectionoutline(SREC,SECT...) which
were defined with the program AQUA. Also composite sections are allowed. The acting
width is taken from the concrete parts only.
Details:
• During the calculation of plate components the plate internal forces at the beam nodes are
multiplied by the cross section width. Therefore, the beam width should not be chosen too
large above columns.
(is not valid in method with excentric beams see TBEX)
• IfsomeQUADgroupsmeetatanode,theaveragevalueoftheplateinternalforcesisused.
Control:
+1 moments My are added
+2 shear forces Vz are added too
+4 axial forces N are added too
+8 torsional moments MT are added too
3-18 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
Default: 7 = My + Vz + N
The processing is cancelled with CTRL PLAB 0
V2: With Ctrl PLAB V2 1 also the next quad node rigth and left is used to evaluate the
added quad forces (to take into account the quad force distribution more acccurate). With Ctrl
PLAB V2 0 only the central node is used.
Default: 1
Output:
• The plate components are included always in the output of the beam internal forces and
moments. Therefore the printout does not occur before the plate node results!
• A statistic of the plate components follows after the beam internal forces and moments.
The maximum plate components are compared with the maximum beam internal forces.
Control of the statistic with the input ECHO PLAB 0-1-2.
Attention: This model can not be used for influence line evaluation with ELLA because ELLA
does not add the slab parts to the beam!

3.3.17 INPL Inplane stiffnesses: Connecting beams to quads
The decisive connection nodes for the beam and disk elements are searched for the transfer
of the moments around the local z axis. The stiffnesses of the bordering QUAD elements are
increased by an inplane moment spring. The appropriate node numbers are printed. The
method can be switched off with CTRL INPL 0.
Following a case where automatically stiff inplane springs are inserted:
Figure3.5: skewframebridgewithsuperstructurebeams
We expect a fixed-end moment MY in the beam, but this would be separated in two moments
in the wall: in a M-yy (around lokal x, lokale quad y-axis may show down) and a moment
M-inplane around the local z-axis of the quads:

In the picture only one stiff inplane spring is shown but ASE creates springs to all neighboring
quad nodes. With this a fixed-end moment MY can develop in the beam and we get:
Figure3.9: CTRLINPL1: createsfixed-endmomentMYinthebeam
Anotherexamplewouldbe: abeamjustattachestoonenodeofaquaddisc. Theautomatically
inserted inplane springs work as if the beam would be extended to the next neighboring quad
nodes:
In generel we recommend to not connect a beam to a single quad node. Please use at least
two nodes. E.g. you can insert a stiff beam without dead load into the quad disc.

With CTLR INPL value these real inplane springs can be factorized, e.g. CTLR INPL 0.5.
Very weak internal rotational springs are also always inserted at all quad shell elements to
prevent the nodes to rotate around their local z axis. These weak internal INPLANE springs

With CTRL DIFF the difference forces (and displacements) between a load case and the pri-

Replacement of rigid supports in dead load direction with soft spring supports, also for linear

rigid support can be changed subsequently into a soft edge support. The support width is
considered here. However, single supports get a factor which is increased with the spring
value multiplied with 5, therefore 5·support area·SOFT. The value SOFT is here the bedding
value in kN/m3. Values which are smaller than 1000 are not possible. CTRL SOFT can be
input also simultaneously for a non-linear analysis with corners which are displaced upwards
(see SYST PROB LIFT).

warping effects. On MCON 1 all rotational masses are suppressed - this should only be used

Further input remarks:
The value of PLC defines a global primary load case. This is used subsequently as default
for the primary load case of all group inputs. Furthermore the displacements of the primary
load case are added then and only then to the displacements of the current load case, if the
PLC has been defined in the SYST input. In the case of geometrical non-linear analysis the
stiffness is calculated for the deformed structure.
TousethegeometricstiffnessofaprimaryloadcaseinalinearanalysispleaserefertoSFIX.
A predeformation with PLC and FACV effects the internal forces moments only for PROB
TH3. On LINE or NONL the deformations of the PLC do not affect the forces, see Chapter
2: Non-linear Analyses and Chapter 5: example Buckling Mode Shapes in Supercritical Re-
gion. The application of a non-stressed predeformation is explained in the school example
ase9_quad_euler_beam.dat.
The stresses of the primary load case are used with GRP FACL=1. If the loads of the pri-
maryloadcaseareappliedsimultaneously,thenthesystemisinequilibriumandnoadditional
displacements arise (if no changes are made in the system).
WithGRPFACL=0thedeformationofaloadcasecanbedefinedhereasnon-stressedscaled
predeformation (see Chapter 5: example Buckling Mode Shapes in Supercritical Region).
If a primary load case with TH3 is defined for an eigenvalue determination, one obtains the
eigenfrequencies of the system under the stresses of the primary load case (accompanying
eigenvalue analysis).
The inputs ITER to FMIN are evaluated only for non-linear analysis.
Explanations to the non-linear iteration method:
Residual forces
New displacements and thus stresses are determined after every iteration
step. Itischecked,whetherplasticising,cracksoranyothernon-lineareffects
have occurred at any elements. The plasticized elements generate different
nodal loads compared to those of the linear analysis. These nodal loads
which were generated by the elements are not anymore in equilibrium with
theexternalnodalloads(afterthefirstiterationstep). Theremainingresidual
forces are applied as additional loading during the next iteration step. Ad-
ditional deformations and a new stress state which in general is closer to
equilibrium result. The maximum residual force is printed for every iteration
and has the dimension kN or kNm.
Graphical control of the residual forces
Ifaniterationendswithresidualforces,apictureoftheresidualforcescanbe
requested in the program WINGRAF with residual forces or support forces.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-29ASE|InputDescription
Since unbalanced residual forces are stored as supported reactions, the
problem zone can be localized with that. Here the real support areas should
not be printed. Often, it is advisable to fade out the real support areas with
BOX and to draw only the interior of the structure. It is often very useful to
also check the residual moments!
Tolerance limit of the iteration
The tolerance limit can be defined with the record SYST. Here the reference
value is the largest nodal value which is available in the system. E.g. for a
maximum nodal load of 200 kN the tolerance limit for the residual forces is =
200 ·0.001 = 0.2 kN (for TOL=0.001). In this case all loads of the system are
used including the inherent stress nodal loads of the elements.
Thetolerancefornon-linearanalysiscanbeinputalsoabsolutelywithSYST
PROB NONL TOL -value.
Example: With the input SYST PROB NONL TOL -0.5 the iteration is inter-
rupted, if the maximum residual force is smaller than the value 0.5 kN.
In addition the convergence of the energy is checked. The energy is propor-
tional to the product of load*displacement. As the load is constant, the value
represents the global displacement. We print the ration of the energy of the
actual iteration to the energy of the first (linear) iteration. In case this value
still increases this is a sign for still increasing deformations. Then ASE does
not stop the iteration in case of fulfilled residual tolerance until also the en-
ergynormissufficientlyconvergent. Incasethisenergyvalueconvergesand
does not increase any more, the displacements came to a standstill. Then
the analysis can often also be accepted although the residual cobnvergencs
is not yet sufficient.
Often you want to have more iterations but a not so strong linit at the end.
This usually results in higher plastic deformations and can be done e.g. with
SYST... ITER 200 TOL -0.1 TOL4 -2.0 TOL8 -6.0.
Iteration method
Thedefaultmethodforproblemsaccordingtothesecond-ordertheoryisthe
Linesearch method with the update of the tangential stiffness (see record
CTRL). The load increment is reduced here internally according to the avail-
able residual forces. If an iteration step proceeds into the right direction,
i.e. in the direction of an energy minimum, then a new tangential stiffness
which enhances the further iteration’s behaviour is generated, if necessary.
Cracked elements are considered here also with a reduced stiffness. The
Crisfield method is the default (CTRL ITER 0) for non-linear calculations ac-
cording to the first-order theory. For convergence problems the user should
attemptalsotheineachcaseothermethod(CTRLITER0orCTRLITER3).
Variation of iteration factors
For convergence difficulties an improvement of the convergence behaviour
can be achieved often via reduction of the maximum f value, e.g. FMAX 1.5.
If the system still not converges, FMAX can be reduced until 0.7. However,
many iteration steps are needed then.
3-30 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
The Crisfield method which is implemented for the improvement of the con-
vergence modifies the displacement increments of the current and of the
last iteration step with the two factors f and e. f values which become alter-
natelylargerandsmallerthan1.0areanindicationofseriousproblems. The
method can be influenced in such cases by specifying maximum and mini-
mum values of factors. A negative value for ITER switches off this method
completely. By contrast, it may occur for tensile failure of stiff elements that
the residual forces change very slowly. Here it is useful to select a large val-
uesforf(e.g. FMAX=999.). Generallyapplicablerecommendationscannot
be given here. EMAX should usually not be changed. First try FMAX 1.5,
then FMAX 0.8, then CTRL ITER 0 or CTRL ITER 3 V2 1.
ThevalueFMAXisincreasinglylimitedduringtheiterationprocess. Thereby
the convergence is improved for many iterations.
Failed foundation and tensile springs
For analyses without consideration of tensile support reactions (non-linear foundation or
springs) the basic foundation values should not be defined too large, because the program
reduces gradually these values until the foundation fails. For too large initial values for the
foundation the iteration converges extremely slowly.
Imperfection
The imperfection can be scaled automatically with the item VMAX. The inputs -1, -2, -3 for
SYST ... FACV control then the direction of the scaling, if desired.
SYST PLC 101 FACV - VMAX 0.05 defines the imperfection of the primary load case 101 with
a three-dimensional deformation of 5 cm.
SYSTPLC101FACV-1VMAX0.5definestheprimaryloadcase101withamaximumimper-
fection u-X of |5 cm|. All other deformations are scaled with the same factor.
SYST PLC 101 FACV -1 VMAX -0.05 as before, however, the imperfection figure is defined
with a negative sign.
Failure Mode Shapes
With a special control it is possible to get a more precise iteration process for the failure mode
shapes in ASE. An analysis according to the second-order and third-order theory does not
convergeinmanycasesanditisunknownwhichfailuremechanismwilloccur. Atfirstasmaller
stable load step should be calculated in advance. Then the following input should be startet:
PROG ASE
HEAD delivers the failure in the iterations load cases 9001-9009..

CTRL ITER 3 V2 1 ! new total stiffness after every step
SYST PROB TH3 ITER -30 PLC 15 ! !!minus!! -30

Using TH3 you should always calculate dynamic and buckling eigen mode shapes on
the last stable load case to give an information about failure problems. See example

Geometry-Update
With SYST STOR the PLC deformed mesh can be stored with the updated nodal coordinates.
SYST STOR=YES: The new local coordinate systems of the QUAD elements are twisted by
the rotations of the load case PLC. They, however, keep the direction defined in the input.
Beam lengths are not updated for loading.
SYST STOR=NEW: The local coordinate systems of the QUAD elements are defined again.
A direction vector or direction point to define the local x axis e.g. from a sysem input in SOFI-
PLUS is taken into account. Beam lengths are updated for loading (it may be necessary to
run SOFILOAD LC TYPE REST). Also cable system length are set new, important e.g. in
formfindung see example csm28_suspension_bridge_real.dat
SYST STOR=XX,YY,ZZ and NEGX,NEGY,NEGZ: The direction of the local x axis is preset
for the new installation of the coordinate system of the elements, cf. program SOFIMSHA/-
SOFIMSHC. Beam lengths are updated for loading.
SYST STOR=ACAD: creates .dxf files with lines of the deformed mesh, further two .txt text
files with the lines for other data conversion.
SYST STOR=CUTT: after membrane cutting pattern: cutting areas and 3D geodetic lines as
.dxf file for Autocad, see example textile1_tennishall.dat
STOR=NEW to STOR=NEGZ acts only to QUAD elements. The local coordinate systems of
beams are twisted generally with the PLC displacements.
Caution:
Allresultsofthenodaldisplacementsareextinguishedduringthegeometryupdate. Therefore
the data base must be saved absolutely before! With the input STOR=NEW to STOR=NEGZ
all other results are extinguished too, because the local directions are twisted. With the input
STOR=YES it is possible to use the old stresses via the record GRP, if no beam elements
are available. It maybe necessaryto updateexisting loads usingSOFILOAD LCTYPE REST,

The analysis of a time step of duration N·DT with direct (Newmark-Wilson) integration is re-

Damping parameters are to be input with record GRP.
Loadfunctions:
In ASE usually nonlinear dynamic is calculated. Therefore the complete stress state including
dead load must be genereated. To the permanent part (dead load) the variable part of the
loading (earthquake, impuls, initial velocity) must be added. It is best to combine the loading
directly in ASE, e.g.:
SYST PLC 1 $ static state
STEP N 100 DT 0.01 LCST 1001
LC 2 DLZ 1
LCC 801 $ permanente additional dead load without load function
LCC 901 $ variable load with load function from SOFILOAD
see step_sofiload_ase.dat
When the variable load starts, the static state already exists. If you first analyze the steady
state in a separate loadcase without time dynamic (e.g. loadcase 1) you can then continue
with the time dynamic analysis using the steady state as a primary loadcase - see SYST PLC
1 above. If you would activate the dead load in the time step analysis for the first time, the
system would accelerate from the unstressed start state and then swing arround the steady
state. This would be the case if you would suddenly remove the formwork from a concrete
girder, see step_nonl_concrete_girder.dat Saving of the results
In order to avoid large databases for the time step method the calculation can occur only with
twoloadcaseswhichvaryineachcase. ThisworksautomaticallyusingSTEPN>1andLCST.

achieve a necessary equilibrium:
DIV=0 - no time step division
DIV=1-9 divide time step max. DIV times, create internal time step division but

DIV=11-19 adapt time step but store each time step. The resulting loadcase se-
qence then has variable delta-t.

For negative DIV, the analysis continues in the shortest time step division also if no sufficient
equilibrium is reached. For DIV>0 the progranm stops.

If a primary load case has been defined in SYST PLC or GRP PLC the first calculation makes
already use of this given primary load case.
If a load should not be increased during the limit load iteration, this can be requested via the
function ’Copy Loads’ with ULTI=NO in the record LCC.
With PRIM YES the new load case makes use of the stable first load case. With PRIM NO the
analysis starts as in the first load case (PLC according to SYST PLC or GRP PLC).
If the second load case ends with convergence too, the last step of the load factor (DFAK) is
multipliedbytheprogressionPROandusedasnewstep. Thethirdloadcaseobtainsthenthe
load factor FAK1 + DFAK + DFAK·PRO and so on.
The default values FAK1=1, DFAK=1 and PRO=2 result in the following load steps:
Load case 1 Factor 1.00
Load case 2 Factor 2.00
Load case 3 Factor 4.00
Load case 4 Factor 8.00
Load case 5 Factor 16.00
Load deformation curves can be calculated with FAK1=1, DFAK=1 and PRO=1 (can be repre-
sented graphically, see example ase9_quad_euler_beam.dat):
Load case 1 Factor 1.00
Load case 2 Factor 2.00
Load case 3 Factor 3.00
Load case 4 Factor 4.00
Load case 5 Factor 5.00
If an iteration is divergent, i.e. equilibrium could not be reached, the last load step increment
is halved. With the default DMIN -0.001 the load step increment will not be taken smaller
than 0.001 times the actual load factor. But this only occurs if also FACE is reduced because
otherwisetheiterationwillstopduetoFACE.WithhigherDMINlocalstabilityproblemsmaybe
eliminated. Theuserhastoconvincehimselfoftheaccuracyofthefinalsolutionbecausealso
non-convergent results may be saved! If strain or stress limits are reached, a negative DMIN
will not be taken into account any longer.

FAKE also if the accuracy is reached. Input -0.02 = 2% (when the two last factors differ less
than 2%).
3-38 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
On SLOW, ASE always checks the load deformation curve. If this curve gets flat, the load will
be increased slower after the first divergency.
A load step is also set to not convergent if a strain or utilisation reaches a limit. With ULTI
EPSC and EPSS strain limits for nonlinear quad elements can be set (default -3.5 per mille
for concrete, 25 per mille for steel). With GRP2 ULUS you can also define a maximum stress
utilisation. For nonlinear beams NSTR CHKC can be used.
If a new stable primary load case is used, the program generates always the new tangential
geometry stiffness matrix.

Attention: it is not enshured that the loadcases created with PUSH can really carry the load-
factor. Aconvergenceoftheresidualforceisnotdemanded. Onlyincasetheresidualforcein
the PUSH iteration converges to 0 a real equilibrium is reached.
The advantage is that with PUSH ASE tries to iterate into the failure. So PUSH can deliver
useful information about the failure mechanism.
SimilartoanarchlengthmethodPUSHincreasesthedisplacementbyagivenfactor. Depend-
ing on the system answer the loadfactor is adapted and can also decrease. Usually it is not
possible to exactly follow a decending path of the load displacement curve but especially in
case of a plateau PUSH can iterate very good into higher displacements and can overcome
minor local stability problems. As PUSH requires a primary loadcase, beams with NSTR S* or
K* are not allowed for PUSHO.
Ahead of a PUSH analysis usually an ULTI analysis is performed. Using PUSH CONT ULTI,
ASE continues on the last ULTI step and increases the deformation. For this, FDL defines
the length of the deformation of the first PUSH step. With FDL 0.3 ASE tries to increase the
deformation of the first ULTI step by 30%. In fig. 3.11 the deformation of the last ULTI step is
plotted in green with length 1.0. With PUSH 4 FDL 0.3 four steps with deformation step length
0.3 follow in red. Finally with PUSH 4 FDL 0.4 CONT PUSH four further steps are added in
yellow. Of course 0.4 now refers to a higher starting length.

EPS Total shrinkage coefficient of NCRE creep steps (negative)
RELZ Relaxation of the prestressing steel (is applied only in the first creep
step fully)
PHIF Total creep step for springs, foundation, FLEX,HASE
but for RCRE CSM the real creep construction stage load part from

To define the creep curves for such elements, best in-
put a dummy concrete element in group 0, see example
hase3_hase3_variable_surface_level.dat
Creepandshrinkagewithconstructionstagesorinbridgedesignshouldbedonewithmodule
CSM (see examples below). Using pure ASE there are two different creep calculations:
1st Plate calculation according to cracked condition in one step
For plates in cracked condition a simplified consideration of creep and shrinkage effects was
implemented in a step. With an input of CREP 1 and GRP PHI EPS creep and shrinkage are
calculated as follows in a load case step without input of a primary load case:
• TheelasticmodulusofconcreteisreducedtoE=E0/(1+PHI)orthestressfromtheworklay
is reduced by 1/(1+PHI).
• The concrete is given a pre-strain of EPS.
3-44 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
Because the shrinkage shortening acts only on the compression side at a cracked cross sec-
tion, shrinkage causes an enlargement of the bending also at plates. At the cracked tensile
side shrinkage acts only on the cracked width. The creep and shrinkage values affect all ele-
ments with material concrete, PHIF affects springs, edges and QUAD foundations, also with a
reduction of the stiffness of 1/(1+PHIF). But not for halfspace. PHIF for halfspace only works
via primary load case PLC.
2nd More complex calculation with use of a primary load case (is used by CSM)
AtthatthetotalcreepisdismantledinNCREcreepintervalswhicharecalculatedinNCREload
cases. The load cases generated automatically by the first LC load case number ascendingly.
The stresses of a primary load case which are accepted as constant during a creep step (or
of the last creep step) are converted into strains. These strains are multiplied by the (with the
modified relaxation coefficient RO) partial creep coefficient DPHI and used as a load for alle
concrete elements . Middle stresses which generates creep are not determined.
Abrupt constraint is applied for creep of the stresses from PLC (reduction of a constraint inter-
nal force):
ZK = Z0 ( 1 - dϕ/(1 + RO·dϕ)) see STAR2 manual
ZKF = Z∞( 1 - dϕf/(1 + RO·dϕ)) (springs + foundation)
For shrinkage a gradual constraint is assumed:
ZS = Z∞ ( 1 /(1 + RO·dϕ)) (shrinkage)
with dϕ=PHI/NCRE
Computation:
Theprogramusesthestressesoftheprimaryloadcaseasstressesproducingcreep. Itapplies
the primary load case in an internal way with FACL=ZK for the corresponding elements. For
tendons the PLC is scheduled only in the first creep step with the factor (1-relz), in all further
creep steps with the factor 1.0.
At shrinkage the partial shrinkage coefficient which was reduced according to Trost is used:
load-strain = dε·ZKF = ε·ZKF/NCRE
Actually the program allows only creep values with dphi < 0.4 in the case of calculations with
primaryloadcase. Ifthestressesproducingcreeparehardlyreducedbycreepandshrinkage,
ROhastobedefinedinacorrespondinglysmallwayormorecreepstepshavetobeinput. For
a prestress from the program TENDON only RO=0 is possible generally in order to avoid an
unintentional reduction of the creep effect for the statically determinate part of the prestress -
possibleincreaseofNCRE.Valuesintheregionof0.8arereasonableforcreepofaconstraint

importance of RO comes in the background.
CreepandshrinkageareeffectiveforallconcreteelementsoftypeBEAM,TRUS,CABL,QUAD
+ BRIC, see overview in the CSM manual. PHIF acts on spring and boundary elements and
on pile- and quad bedding. Thereby the QUAD foundation can get another creep coefficient
(settlement) independently of the QUAD element. RELZ acts only on tendons of the plate
prestress.
SOFiSTiK2023 3-45ASE|InputDescription
With CREP BEAM it can be controlled, whether the creep calculation for bending beams via
creep curvatures is taken over from AQB (CREP BEAM=AQB) or whether it should be de-
termined in ASE (CREP BEAM=ASE = default). Caution: Prestressed beams have to be
calculated with AQB! Please refer to program CSM.
The program extension ASE1 is necessary for creep calculations.

A stiffness reduction may be defined with FACS for 2nd/3rd order theory (1/γ m-multiple).
The loading components from the stresses of the primary state are multiplied by FACL to the
load case which is to be calculated. FACD defines a dead weight loading with the values
GAM/GAMA of the material record in dead weight direction. This loading is usually in equilib-
rium with the primary state. The loads from FACL and FACD act in all load cases of the input
block.
If the old loads of the primary load case ( PLC) are applied simultaneously to a system with
the loads from the primary stresses with FACL=1, these both loading cancel themselves. New
deformations do not result. Therefore the loads from the primary stresses oppose the old
loads.

Prestress of elements via record GRP: GRP - PREX PREY
With GRP ... PREX PREY a real prestress can be defined in addition to TRUS-CABL-SPRI
also for QUAD and BEAM elements. This acts, first of all, as a normal prestressed load.
However, it is considered also with the factor CTRL PRES for the initial stiffness. In this way
membrane and cable structures can be calculated more simply according to the third-order
theory. A membrane high point should be input via the record HIGH.
WithspringsyoucanuseGRP... PREXtosimulateasupportlifting. E.g. youusedacoupling
spring in group 7 with stiffness 1.E6, you can achieve a support lifting by 1 cm with GRP 7
PREX -1.E4.
The value from GRP ... PREX PREY is interpreted in kN/m for QUAD, and in kN for BEAM,
TRUS, CABL and SPRI. For cables with the additional input PREY ’hori’ a horizontal compo-
nentcanbedefined. Therealcableprestressisthenappliedhigherdependingonthegradient

of the cable.
TheGRPprestressactsalsoforlinearcalculation. Astabilizationfortheerrorestimatecanbe
achieved in this way at displaced systems. In addition the prestress is considered also for an
eigenvalue determination!
Differences of the input of a truss or cable prestress in the program SOFIMSHA/SOFIMSHC
for the GRP prestress:
- SOFIMSHA-PRE acts in all load cases as long as a primary load case (PLC) is not used.
- GRP-PREX acts only in ASE calculations in which it is input, however, in the record GRP
in addition to a prestress of a primary load case.
Creep for composite systems concrete + steel
A separate item PHIS can be input in the record GRP for elements which do not consist of
concrete. Elements of concrete are processed with GRP ... PHI,EPS. Springs, boundary ele-
ments and elastic foundations are processed with GRP ... PHIF without shrinkage. Elements
whose cross section material is not concrete are processed with GRP ... PHIS. Shrinkage of
these elements is considered with the value EPS·PHIS/PHI.
For BEAM composite cross sections and BEAM prestressed concrete cross sections creep
and shrinkage have to be processed with the program AQB.
The prestressing steel relaxation of the QUAD tendons is determined automatically with the
input RELZ AUTO in combination with the time duration input T in record CREP. The material
values STEE ... REL1+REL2 from the program AQUA are used..
Stiffness development of elements with concrete
For input of the temperature adjusted concrete age T1 in GRP...T1, the development of stiff-
ness of concrete elements is taken into account. The program CSM automatically adjusts T1
in dependence on the given temperature. The development is plotted for the first concrete
material (for ECHO MAT FULL for all concrete materials and also for calculations with primary
load case).
Function for prefabricated bridges
TemporaryBEAMpin-jointscanbefixedwithGRPHINGFIX.Thusaconstructionstagecanbe
calculated with pin-joint and a final stage without pin-joint. The results can be superpositioned
and designed. All pin-joints are active with the default GRP HING ACTI.

In the first input line (without ROW) also a group list is allowed, e.g. Q8x8 FROM 2,5,14
With a pure input Q8x8 without further values the info in the database can be deleted.
Q8x8 is used in timber analysis. Stiffness values can be found e.g. on the internet page of

Ifgenuinehighpointsatmembranesareavailable,anorthotropicprestresswithafixedratioof
the tangential/radial prestress is wanted also mostly. A radial stress which increases itself to
the high point is necessary here. This axisymmetric high point-stress state is generated with
the record HIGH. Here PR1 defines the radial stress in 1 m distance to the high point. PTPR
defines the ratio of the tangential to the radial prestress.
Membranes should be generated with triangulas elements (SOFIPLUS export triangles).
Examples see Theoretical principles.
Example of a high point at X = 5.0 m, Y = 0.0 m:
HIGH 5[m] 0[m] PR1 20 PTPR 0.4
shows:
σ-R in 1m distance = 20.00 kN/m
corresponding-σ-T = 8.00 kN/m (0.4*20)
and from causes of the equilibrium for example in 10 m distance:
σ-R= PR1·1/r·eˆ(PTPR·ln(r))= 20·1/10·exp(0.4·ln(10))= 5.02 kN/m
corresponding-σ-T = 2.01 kN/m (0.4·5.02)
If the distance is larger than 1000 m, a constant prestress is assumed. The stress in direction
to the high point is then always PR1, the stress orthogonal to this direction is PTPR·PR1,
therefore without radial reduction as described above. The advantage is in the simple input of
skew prestress independently of the direction of the local element coordinate systems! The

With the input TBEX a group of beam elements can be advised to perform the t-beam-

is substracted, the beam forces corrected and of course the dead load not applied twice. The
3-60 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
quad elements as well as the in situ concrete in the beam section can and should have a
normal dead load factor gamma in the material.
Inversion2018itwasnecessarytoreducethenormalstiffnessofthequadswithGRP2QUEA
if you used excentric beams in the t-beam-philosophy. With version 2020 the excentric TBEX
t-beam-philosophy also works with full isotropic quads. You may use GRP2 QUEA in addition
to TBEX to get the same behavior as in version 2018 but it is not necessary and not recom-
mended. In special cases you can reduce the E*A stiffness only for creep and shrinkage ->
see CSM manula TBEX.
Using TBEX you now get a quad membrane compression force in midspan AND the beam
gets a compression stress in the section top slab. This looks like the stress is taken twice but
internally a separate negative stiffness creates a negative reduction stress (correction beam).
This additional correction force is also taken into account in a SIR or DECREATOR cut. There
the sum of normal stress matches with the external acting force.
In the design all elements are designed correctly:
- the beam is designed in AQB including the normal stresses in the deck concrete slab
- the quad slab is designed in BEMESS including the normal stress from the global bending
For the upper reinforcement in the deck slab, the value of the beam design must not be added
to the value of the quad design. The maximum of both results can be used.

In case the upper concrete slab is haunched, the exact value of the double area can be input

excentric quads EX_Q must be input positive (the sign is internally adapted to the quads). On

SOFiSTiK2023 3-61ASE|InputDescription
wich NEFF:
NEFF: in case of a great width of the deck slab, the effective width over middle supports is
smaller. Also the effect of the quad slab for global bending MY is lower in this case - the
normal forces need some time (some space) to expand into the slab. This can be taken into
account with NEFF. With e.g. NEFF 0.2 you define that 20% of the area AREA of the deck
slab shall not be active for global bending MY. Intern the IY of the correction beam is reduced
and the correction beam is shifted 20% into the direction of the beam center. This reduces
the effect of the correction beam for MY global bending. The area of the correction beam is
not touched as there shall be no effect on the beam normal force N (prestress). Without an
input to TBEX-NEFF, ASE extracts a corresponding factor from the section in case NEFF has
been used in the AQUA section. Nevertheless the TBEX behavior can be adjusted with NEFF,
see example t_beam_bridge_excentric.dat and t_beam_excentric_test.dat . Common values
are NEFF=0.00 in midspan and NEFF=0.20 over middle supports. If you input NEFF in the
sections you can also work without NEFF in the TBEX input.
In case of steel composite sections, the pure steel part has a low transverse stiffness. Then a
freerotationofthenodesverticaltothequadsmaycauseaninstableequationssystem. Then
a reduction of F_IZ may help. To scale the VZ shear results you can also adjust GAZ with
f_GZ.
FIXE : ASE softens the TBEX effect a little bit at the end of a beam sequence. This can be
switchedoffwithFIXE1(withFIXE0.5yougetalowerreductioncomparedtothedefault,with
FIXE -0.5 a little higher TBEX reduction at beam sequence ends).
It may happen that with TBEX unexpected normal forces occur. If this disadvantage counts
more than the advantage of a full isotropic slab (better load distribution, transverse prestress)
you can also use the quad slab without normal stiffness with GRP2 QUEA 1E-5 as shown in
loadcase 103 in t_beam_excentric_test.dat.
Instable systems: as the correction beam is inserted with a negative stiffness it may occur
that the solver reports negative determinants. Then please follow the instructions in the error

LCRS Stored number of the reinforcement distribution − 99
CHKR steel stress from where an increase of reinforcement [N/mm2] -
1092
shall occur (old CHKS also still accepted)
ASE performs a nonlinear analysis of plates and shells according to cracked condition with a
given reinforcement. An increase of reinforcement can be controlled via REIQ-CHKR.
For the given reinforcement in any case the minimum reinforcement from BEMESS PARA or
thedesignparameterdialogisused. Thereinforcementdirection,concretecover,bardiameter
and other data are also taken from there.
With REIQ a reinforcement of a design case LCR can be used from the design (BEMESS).
Nodal reinforcements are applied in all adjacent elements to get enough reinforcement in the
gauss points = shift of reinforcement. Element reinforcement is applied as well.
The superposition of the minimum reinforcement with a design-reinforcement from BEMESS
is stored as now really used reinforcement distribution LCRS for graphical checks. If the rein-
forcement is increases due to CHKR, the increased reinforcement is stored.
Example see a2_nonlinear_slab.dat
CHKR: due to redistribution of forces in the nonlinear analysis often higher forces occur in
previous lower forced regions. This can cause very high steel stress and crack width due to
the low reinforcement of the linear design in these regions. With input of a limit for the steel
stressCHKRASEthenincreasesthereinforcementduringthenonlineariterationstokeepthe
steel stresses below CHKR. Intern ASE does not check the steel stress but the strain. So
also in elements without given reinforcement a reinforcement is inserted if the strain exceeds
CHKR/ES with ES=200000. This is to avoid big cracks also in such elements. A run with the
minimum reinforcement without an LCR of BEMESS just input NSTR - CHKR 400. If ASE
increases a reinforcement due to CHKR, ASE ends with an error message and the advise to
check the new necessary total reinforcement id design case LCRS (an error message is done
to clearly point out this issue).
Please also notice that even in pure slabs horizontal deflections and normal forces occur due
to the crack opening in a nonlinear analysis. Such (excentric) compression normal stressses
can carry a part of the load and reduced the pure bending moments.
For beam elements input for reinforcement cases are possible in BEW.
3-64 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
For the reinforcement direction the following rules are valid:
- At first they are used from BEMESS PARA or the design parameter dialog
- BEMESS or SOFICAD-B reinforcement is taken into account with the smallest angle
deviation to already existing directions.
- If nothing is defined, reinforcement bars are used with an angle of 0 and 90 degree.

XX,YY,ZZ
With OBLI it is possible to input a global inclination of the system. With the input of SX=1/200
for example all nodes get an inclination of u-x=1/200·height. The used height is the height
above the node which is the lowest one in dead weight direction (see program SOFIMSHA/-
SOFIMSHC record SYST GDIR).
The global inclination affects also the linear calculation according to first-order theory. It acts
on all elements and also on mixed systems for example from beam and shell elements. In the
same way a imperfection of the beam axes is considered due to the misalignment → lateral
buckling.
The input OBLI must occur before the definition of the load cases and acts then for all load
cases of this ASE calculation.
Imperfection
With OBLI LC FACV an additional load case can be defined for imperfections, also if
anotherprimaryloadcaseisusedwithSYSTPLC.TheimperfectionloadcaseinOBLIisused
always as a non-stressed one and the normally usual input GRP ... FACL is not necessary.
Thus the input is easier and simultaneously more flexible. The input SYST ... FACV should
be omitted in future. Alternatively (to FACL) a maximum imperfection can be scaled with
OBLI VMAX. DIRE defines the scaling direction if necessary (without DIRE the maximum
diplacementvector is scaled). For example OBLI LC 91 VMAX -0.050 DIRE YY describes an
imperfection affin to load case 91 with a maximum value in global Y direction of - 50 mm.
An imperfection has here effects on the internal forces and moments of the first- and
second-ordertheory. Noteplease,thatanimperfectionviaOBLIdoesnotgeneratelocalbeam

Item Description Unit Default
NOSL SLIP cable number − -
NOG Group number of the cable elements − -
group 0 is not allowed
NOEL Element number of the cable element − -
MUE friction value − 0
A SLIP cable group contains a number of cable elements that act as a single cable.
SLIP NOSL 4 NOG 4 assigns all cables of the element group 4 to the SLIP Cable No
4.
SLIP NOSL 5 NOEL 717,718,719 summarizes the cable elements to the SLIP Cable
5.
There are two types of slip cables: with friction or without friction
Slip Cable without friction:
On mue=0 a common normal force is enforced for all single cables. Thus they can slide
at intermediate points. The common normal force is determined from the total strain of the
corresponding cables divided by their total length. As all cables together build a total stiffness
bubble,thisalsoworksinalinearanalysis. Buttherefortheinnercablesaggingisautomatically
switched off for these cables. In WINGARF/GRAFIX the axial displacement shows the nodal
deformation change. This can be used to visualize the slip effect. Furthermore the slip is
printed in the ASE output.
Example see slip_cable.dat
Slip Cable with friction:
Important: using Slip cables with friction the cable sequence is important! The friction is
calculated from one cable to the next in the sequence of the cable number.
On mue>0.0 a slip cable only slips in case the force difference exceeds the friction. As this is
not known a priori in a linear analsis, a cable with mue>0.0 only slips in a nonlinear analysis!
In Fig. 3.15 the left cable is stressed and the right cable is released under a horizontal loading
ofthemast. Incasetheforcedifferencewouldexceedsthefrictionatthecrosshead,thecable
slips in a nonlinear analysis. Thus the left cable will get longer, the right cable shorter. See

the two cable ends and a friction effect, see fig. 3.16. But then all individual cables must have
a sagging. If e.g. one vertical cable is inside the slip group, then die inner cable sagging is
switched off for all cables of the slip group.

VOLU defines an air volume on a face of quad elements. VOLU distributes the air pressure
uniformly onto the participated surfaces. VOLU is mainly used for membrane air cushions.
VOLU can work in two different ways:
With P0 input the air pressure P0 remains constant, the air volume can change with deforma-
tions (connected air compressor).
Without P0 the amount of air is constant and the pressure will change on loading and defor-
mations.
Without P0 input ASE generates a stiffness matrix that represents the compressibility of the
enclosed air volume (stiffness bubble). With P0 input this is not necessary and the analysis is
much faster.
An air pressure defined with VOLU-P0 is updated during the ASE-iterations and loads the ro-
tatedquadarea. Alsoanincreaseofthequadareaduringformfindingupdatestheairpressure
load! This is not done using SOFILOAD loads - see example air_volume_tennis.dat
An input VOLU without further data delets VOLU elements of a previous ASE run. Without
3-72 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
VOLU-input all VOLU data is taken from the last run but without old load input P0, DV ir DT.
With a VOLU input using only the VOLU number (without GRP, POSI, VO input) new loads for

then only defines the rough direction in which the spring will look for a contact. The length -
important for the contact - will then be defined in ASE MOVS L0.
The definition of MOVS in an ASE calculation is maintained in the database. It is used also
in the following calculations. A new MOVS input in a further ASE calculation or a MOVS input
without further parameters deletes the MOVS definition in the database.

An input LAUN shifts the nodes of the element group GRP with DX,DY,DZ. An input of XM
and YM rotates around the centre point with PHI [ rad] as arc length (around global Z axis).
Starting on a PLC primary load case, the launching input is the new total displacement.

Problems may occur if two beams attach to a node and one beam rotates and the other not.
Then the nodal LAUN nodal rotation is not clear and we assume:
If the starting node of a beam rotates, the local coordinate system of the beam rotates. If the
starting node of a beam does not rotate, the beam does not rotate (as shown in the animator

cable stiffness
Usage with one input line SFIX LC:
With one input line SFIX LC (PLC is set to LC) for all elements (BEAM,QUAD,SPRI...) the ge-
ometric stiffness according to the normalforce of the PLC is added. So e.g. a set of loadcases
canbeanalyzedwithauniquegeometricstiffness(TH3). Thisallowsalatersuperpositionwith
MAXIMA (linearization of the analysis). If a nonlinear material stiffness had been calculated
with AQB in the PLC, this nonlinear stiffness is also used.
In case the PLF was analyzed with inner cable sagging, the effective stiffness of the PLC is
used. So for a cable stayed bridge you can first optimize a geometric nonlinear final system
with CSM-OPTI and then use the effective stiffness for further quasi linear analysis.
Usage with multiple input lines for beam systems:
Here the minimum of the AQB stiffness is determined from a series of load cases LC. With
that and together with the geometrical stiffness from the normal force of a PLC a linear beam
calculationisperformed,sothatthesuperpositionprincipleisvalidforfollowingsuperposition.

See also theorectical background, Active Bending
Usage e.g. ACTB 2,3 :
The beam elements of group 2 and 3 are treated as active bending elements and get a stress
state that would relax the beam to a straight beam if no further loads or fixings act.
Or in other words: it is assumed that the beam originally was a straight beam and was only
bended linear into the sytem shape.
Example see active_bending_overview.dat
In case the start and the end of the Active Bending beam chain is not restraint, MEND FREE
can be input. Then at the first and last node definitely no curvature stress state is applied.
Incasealsoatorsionalcurvatureshallbeanalyzedfromthesystemcurvature,MTFIXshould
be input. But also without MT FIX ASE will calculate a torsional moment in the beams if this is
necessary for the equilibrium. But then an additional torsional curvature will appear.

LC ALL calculates all load cases stored in the database from LC 1 to 9999.
LCTESTwithoutfurtherinputactivatestheinstabilitytest. Comesaufomaticallyonlyforinsta-
ble systems.
For a negative dead load direction which is defined in the program SOFIMSHA/SOFIMSHC
with SYST GDIR (e.g. SYST...GDIR=NEGZ) a positive value has to be input in LC DLx for a
load in dead load direction (negative global direction). An error message follows for the input
of a negative value (e.g. LC DLZ -1.00), because a double negation is misleading. A warning
follows for a negative inputs unequal to -1.00 (e.g. for earthquake).
We recommend to use LC FACD 1.0. This works as in SOFILOAD. A positive input creates a
load in dead load direction.
If dead loads should be used from the program SOFiLOAD, then only the load case number
NO has to be input for LC. If factors of the structural dead weight or other loading are defined
after a LC record, all loading data for that load case will be deleted, to allow the redefinition of
loading for a given load case.
If no designation was input, the program generates automatically a title from the dead load
factors as well as from the support sum.
The action type and the corresponding safety factors and combination coefficients may be
defined already here for a later superposition with program MAXIMA. Several literals which
are described in detail in the record ACT of the program SOFILOAD are possible for TYPE. If
safetyfactorsandcombinationcoefficientswhicharedifferentfromthedefaultshouldbeused,
these can be input here. If the superposition factors are defined with the program SOFiLOAD
or MAXIMA, nothing is to be input here for TYPE to PS1S.
Values CRI1 to CRI3 are very general parameters of the load case. They may be used freely
forpostprocessing. Youmayspecifytheminadvanceorsetthemaftertheanalysisbyreading
some results from the database. (e.g. a system dimension, a strength reduction etc.) TALPA
uses CRI1 for the safety factor of the material needed by analysis according to Fellenius. The
criteria are set subsequently without further inputs with:
LC TYPE PROP CRI1 ... CRI2 ... CRI3 ...
During dynamic analysis ASE determines the dead weight of all elements according to its
definition in the material records respective the cross section parameters. Additional masses
can be defined with the record MASS. Therefore for eigenvalue determinations the dead load
has not to be input in the record LC. For the dynamic time step method the mass inputs from
ASE or DYNA are transformed to dead loads now with an input LC...DLZ, because these are
used as masses and therefore they have to produce dead load. Vertical slab eigenvalues can
be avoided with MASS FACT.
With LC FACT ’iter’ the last factor of a CSM optimization can be used.

More detailed explanation on temperature and PLC YES/NEW:
The most important idea is:
Please think of the situation that you use a primary load case and apply the same loads, that
means you will not get additional deformations:
-youusethePLCinSYST-withthis,allelementsgetthestressfromthePLCandtheywould
like to deform backwards without other loads
- to avoid this you must apply the same loads as in the PLC so that these loads are in equilib-
rium with the stresss from the PLC
Now to temperature:
The temperature is not a real external load but only introduces stresses in the elements.
If you only apply a temperature load in load case 1, the elements will get longer without any
stress (unrestrained system).
Ifyouuseloadcase1asprimaryloadcasePLC(LC1hasnostress)withoutanynewloading
(also without temperature), the new total load vector is 0 and you will not get any delta defor-
mation, that means the deformation and load case two will be the same as in loadcase 1 =
correct.
If you use load case 1 as primary load case PLC and apply a loadcase LCC PLC NEW with
newtemperature(thesametemperature),theelementswillgetadeltaelongation,thatmeans
the deformation will be twice the deformation of loadcase 1 !!!!
You see real loads in kN must be applied again, but temperature loads not !!!!

The masses are additional to those defined in the program SOFIMSH*. They are maintained

also produce dead load in a static analysis! ASE additional masses don’t act as dead load

MASS LC 0 additional masses defined in a previous run are applied.
A mass acts usually the same in all three coordinate directions and thus, it need to be defined
independently only for special cases. Rotational masses with inclined axis are not used in
ASE.

beam elements also create rotational massses.

factorized additionally with MX,MY and MZ, e.g. MASS LC 12 PRZ 100 MX 1.0 MY 0.2 MZ

many low frequencies which are not essential for the analysis. With the input
MASS FACT MZ 0.01

With REIN RMOD ACCU LCR nnn it is possible to add up to 255 reinforcement results as
active reinforcement of this run. It will be saved with the last defined LCR entry
SUPE cannot be used during an iteration, since then the maximum reinforcement for an itera-
tion step will not be able to be reduced. STAR2 therefore ignores a specification of SUPE, as
longasconvergencehasnotbeenreached. AQBcanupdateorsuperposethereinforcements
at a later time: with REIN RMOD SUPE but without any DESI input.
A specification of BEAM, SPAN, GLOB or TOTL under MOD refers to interpolated sections or
sections with the same section number. For all connected ranges with the same section, the
maximum for the range multiplied with SFAC is incorporated as the minimum reinforcement.
The design is done separately in each case for each load, however, so that the user can
recognize the relevant load cases.

Astheexistingreinforcementhasaconsiderableimpactonthesheardesign,AQBwillperform
an intermediate superposition after the design for normal force and bending moments. How-
ever, use of minimum reinforcement in ultimate load design has also a detrimental effect on
the shear reinforcement, since the lever of internal forces is reduced. The user can take the
appropriate precautions by specifying a minimum lever arm in AQUA.
Since this latter effect is especially strong with tendons, AQBS can give special effect to the
latter in ultimate load design. This option is controlled with ZGRP:
ZGRP = 0 Tendons are considered with both their area and their prestressing. Normal
reinforcement is specified at the minimum percentage.
The relative loading capacity is found.
ZGRP > 0 Tendons are specified with their full prestressing, but with their area (stress
increase) only specified in so far as necessary. Normal reinforcement if in-
stalled only if the prestressing steel alone is not sufficient.
A required area of prestressing steel is determined.
ZGRP < 0 Tendons are specified with their prestressing, only specified in so far as nec-
essary, otherwise the same like ZGRP > 0.
If ZGRP < > 0 has been specified, the tendons are grouped into tendon groups. The group is
a whole number proportion which comes from dividing the identification number of the tendon
SOFiSTiK2023 3-95ASE|InputDescription
by ZGRP. Group 0 is specified with its whole area, the upper group as needed. Any group
higher than 4 is assigned group 4. The group number of the tendons is independent of the
group number of the non-prestressed reinforcement.
Assume that tendons with the numbers 1, 21, 22 and 101 have been defined. With the appro-
priate inputs for ZGRP, the following division is obtained:
ZGRP 0 All tendons are minimum reinforcement
ZGRP 10 Tendon 1 is group 0 and minimum reinforcement
Tendons 21 and 22 are group 2 and extra
Tendon 101 is group 4 and extra
ZGRP 100 Tendons 1, 21 and 22 are minimum reinforcement
Tendon 101 is group 1, extra
An example of the effect can be found in Section 5.1.5.3.
Notes: Parameters for determining reinforcement
The following parameters are not to be changed by the user in general:
Default Typical
P7 Weighting factor, axial force 5 0.5 - 50
P8 Weighting factor moments -2 -2
When designing, the strain plane is iterated by the BFGS method. The required rein-
forcementisdeterminedintheinnermostloopaccordingtotheminimumofthesquared

F1=P7·(zm−zmn)P8
F2=P7·(ym−ymn)P8
The default value for P8 leads to the same dimensions for the errors. The value of
P7 has been determined empirically. With symmetrical reinforcement and tension it is
bettertochooseasmallervalue,withmultiplelayersandcompressionalargerone. For
small maximum values of the reinforcement the value of P7 should be increased.
Default Typical

none. In these cases the user can increase the value of P7 or can vary the value of
P10between0.2and1.0,forindividualsections. Inmostcases,however,problemsare
caused by specifying the minimum reinforcement improper.

The safety factors referenced above refer to the values defined with the material in AQUA.

the DESI record are applied. However the additional safety factor γ’ for high strength concrete
of DIN will be applied additionally. The printout will flag ”global safety factors”
With Option ”D” we have to distinguish between two different cases:
• If the values defined in DESI are < 1.0 or negative or SC1 is not equal SC2 (e.g. ACI or
odl DIN) or the design code has special provisions for that (SNIP), the safety factors are
multiplicative. Printed stresses contain only the safety factors of the materials.
• In all other cases the value from the material will be taken instead of the default value of
DESI.HoweverifthesafetyfactorisexplicitlydefinedwithDESIwithavalue>1theoption
D will be deactivated with a warning. (Attention: has been changed Sept. 2008)
If a design without any safety factors is required, all saftey factors have to be specified as 1.0
which will then change the default for KSV/B to UL.
PL resp. PLD will modify for some design codes (DIN, EC, ACI) the stress strain law to a
constant equivalent stress block, i.e. the stress value and the strain range will be modified
according to the provisions of those codes.
With the special definition of SS1 NRIL the safety factors of the reinforcements will be set to
1.05 and 1.10 according to the provisions of the German ”Nachrechnungsrichtlinie”, also the
ordinates of those reinforcements will be reduced then by an offset of 20 resp. 10 mm.
The minimum reinforcements AM1 to AM4 are preset according to the design code (INI file)
and apply to all cross sections; they are input as a percentage of the section area.
The relevant value is the maximum of the minimum reinforcements:
- Absolute minimum reinforcement (AM1/AM2)
- Minimum reinforcement of statically required section
- Minimum reinforcement defined in cross section program AQUA
- Minimum reinforcement stored in the database

tions.
3-100 SOFiSTiK2023InputDescription|ASE
Defaults for strain limits and safety coefficients depend on the selected design code and the
type of load combination. They may be specified in the INI-file of the design code. If SC1 and
SC2aredefineddifferent(e.g. oldDIN1045,ACI),thenthesafetyfactorsofthereinforcements
will be also interpolated if SS1 is equal to SC1.
The maximum strain depends on the stress-strain curve. The value of 2.2 is reduced for ex-
ample at the old DIN or high strength concrete automatically. The EN and the DIN suggest to
limit the strain also for the midpoint of compressive flanges. This option may be selected by
defining a value of C2 as positive (select teh control) or negative (disable the control).
ThevaluesZ1andZ2donotlimittherangeofpossiblestrains,butthemaximumcorresponding
valuesareusedasstrainincrementsforthetensionmembersinthesection. Thisisnecessary,
for instance, when designing with partial prestressing under DIN 4227 Part 2.
According to DIN 1045-1 8.2 (3) some bending structures should have a height of the com-
pressivezonenotlargerthan0.45d,or0.35dforhighstrengthconcrete. Ifthisisnotfulfilleda
minimumshearlinkaccordingto13.1.1. (5)hastobeprovided. Asthemaximumcompressive
strain is fixed (3.5 per mille), this is equivalent to the request that the steel strain has at least a
value of 4.278 or a higher value for C55 on.
Thus the control of this paragraph is easily performed via the steel strain. An equivalent for-
mulationisgiveninOENORM4700,whereitisrequestedthatthesteelshouldreachtheyield
strength. As the old DIN 1045 had the more general formulation for the same ductile request,
thatthecompressivereinforcementisnotallowedtobeconsideredwithalargervaluethanthe
tensile reinforcement
Thus AQB provides symmetric reinforcements for all design codes when the steel strain does
not exceed the value of S1, fulfilling the request for ductility in that way.
This design operation is also suitable for non-reinforced sections. In that case the program
produces internal forces and moments which are in the same proportion to each other as the
external forces and moments. The safety factors SC1 and SC2 have to be defined dependent
on the design code. The program then shows the relative load carrying capacity and prints a
warning if this should fall below 1.0.
The shear design finds the lever of internal forces for all load cases with compression and
tensionforcesinthesection,andfindstheshearstressandshearreinforcementresultingfrom
shearing force and torsion. The shear stress limits are set automatically depending on SMOD
and the material. Deviating values for the shear stress limits can be defined within AQB with a
record STRE (under 4227 only) or TVS. Since in case of excess of the shear stress limits no
designmoreoccurs,thiscanbeexceededontoownresponsibilityoftheuserwithatolerance.
For the reduction of the shear capacity for tensile members the normal stress σ pc is limited to
the value MSCD. The default is selected with the mean tensile strength fctm.
Consideration of the shift of the envelope line of the tensile force (shift rule) depends upon
the CTRL option VM. The ratio Ved/Vrd,max and the value of the shift will be saved to the
database.
If a section is to be considered as a plate has already been defined with the section itself. The
definition of KTAU is thus only effective for those sections.
