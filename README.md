# SOFi_Chatbot
## Intro / Motivation
The Chatbot was done as part of a course on finite element analysis of structures using the SOFiSTiK software package, especially their language cadinp. The chatbot should show the future of working with the software with a LLM (large language model) "co-pilot". 
The database is continuously expanded by the author.

## Data
The Chatbot has access to different Teddy Examples (see Data Folder):
- Examples provided by the Author
- Examples provided by Sofistik in their Software
- Handbooks from Sofistik (PDFs simply transformed into txt files using pdfplumber library)
The author claims no ownership over the examples and handbooks from SOFiSTiK. As also of his own examples - the data can be used freely.

## Chat Engine
Currently the used model is GPT-4 (however, might be switches back to 3.5-turbo due to financial reasons :))
